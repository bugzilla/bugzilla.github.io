Introduction
************

This document contains the release notes for Bugzilla 2.18 and
the bugfix releases after 2.18. In this document, recently added,
changed, and removed features of Bugzilla are described.

The 2.18 release is our current stable series, containing the results
of over two years of hard and dedicated work by volunteers all over 
the world under the lead of Dave Miller.


Important Updates In This Point Release
***************************************

There are usually many other bug fixes than those listed below,
but the below fixes are the ones that we thought System Administrators
would like to specifically know about.

To see a listing of all changes in this release, you can use the
table available at:

https://github.com/bugzilla/bugzilla.github.io/compare/2.18

Version 2.18.1
--------------

+ You can now enter a negative time for "Hours Worked"
  in the time-tracking area. (Bug 271276)

+ The BugMail.pm customization required for Windows (as
  described in the Bugzilla Guide) now actually works. (Bug 280911)

+ Users who were using Bugzilla 2.8 can now successfully upgrade
  to 2.18.1 (they couldn't upgrade to 2.18). (Bug 283403)

+ Dependency mails are now properly sent during a mass-change of bugs.
  (Bug 178157)


Version 2.18.2
--------------

+ You can now create accounts with createaccount.cgi even
  when the "requirelogin" parameter is turned on. (Bug 294778)

+ Bugs that are in disabled groups may not show a padlock
  on the bug list, or may otherwise behave strangely. You
  can now fix this using sanitycheck.cgi. (Bug 277454)

+ If sendmail dies while you are marking a bug 
  as a duplicate, the duplicates table will no longer become 
  corrupted. (Bug 225042)

Version 2.18.3
--------------

+ The query.cgi page was broken in 2.18.2 by bug 300138.
  That is now fixed.

What's New?
***********

Generic Reporting
-----------------

Bugzilla has a new mechanism for generating reports of the current state of
the bug database.  It has two related parts: a table-based view, and several
graphical views.

The table-based view allows you to specify an x, y and z (multiple tables of
data) axis to plot, and then restrict the bugs plotted using the standard
query form.  You can view the resulting data as an HTML or CSV export (e.g.:
for importing into a spreadsheet).

There are also bar, line and pie charts, which are defined in a very similar
way.  These views may be more appropriate for particular data types, and are
suitable for saving and then putting into presentations or web pages.


Generic Charting
----------------

Bugzilla has a new mechanism for generating charts (graphs over time) of any
arbitrary search. This is known as "New Charts." Legacy data from the previous
charting mechanism ("Old Charts") is migrated into the "New Charts" when you
upgrade. The Old Charts mechanism remains, but is deprecated and will be 
removed in a future version of Bugzilla.

Individual users can see/create charts as long as they are a member of the 
group specified in the Param 'chartgroup'. Data can be collected for 
personal charts every seven days (or a longer period, as set by the user). 
Charts created by an administrator can be made public (visible to all). Data 
is collected for administrator charts every day (or a longer period, as set 
by the admin).

The data is collected by the collectstats.pl script, which an administrator 
will need to arrange to be run once every day (see the manual). Chart data can
be plotted in a number of different ways, and different data sets can be
plotted on the same graph for comparison.

Please see the Known Bugs section for some important limitations relating to
access controls on charts.


Request System
---------------

The Request System (RS) is a set of enhancements that adds powerful flag
(superset of the old attachment status) features to the bugs.

RS allows for four states: off, granted, denied, and (optionally) requested,
where "granted" is the equivalent of "on". These additions mean it is no
longer necessary to define a status to negate another status (e.g.
"needs-work" to negate "has-review") because negation is built into each
status via the status' "denied" state.  Bug statuses: Previously only
attachments could have these kinds of statuses. RS enables them for bugs as
well. This feature can be used to request and grant/deny certain properties
for a bug, such as inclusion for a specific milestone or approval for checkin.
This way, Bugzilla supports the natural decision-making process in your
organization.

- Requests: Flags can now optionally be made requestable, which means users
  can ask other users to set them. When a user requests a flag, Bugzilla
  emails the requestee and adds the request to a browsable queue so both the
  requester and the requestee can keep track of its status. Once the
  requestee fulfills the request by setting the flag to either granted or
  denied, Bugzilla emails the requestee and removes the request from the
  queue.  This feature supports workflow like the mozilla.org code review
  and milestone approval processes, whereby code is peer reviewed before
  being committed and patches get approved by product release managers for
  inclusion in specific product releases.

- Product/component specificity: Previously flags were product-specific, and
  if you wanted the same flag for multiple products you had to define
  multiple flags with the same name. Flags are now
  product/component-specific, and a single flag can be enabled or disabled
  for multiple product/component combinations via inclusions and exclusions
  lists. Flags are enabled for all combinations on their inclusions list
  except those that appear on their exclusions list.


Enterprise Group Support
------------------------

Bugzilla is no longer limited to 55 access control groups. Administrators can
define an arbitrary number of access groups composed of individual users or
other groups.  The groups can be configured via the web interface to achieve a
wide variety of access control policies. See the documentation section on
'Groups And Group Controls' for details.


User Wildcard Matching
----------------------

Sites can now enable the use of wildcards and substrings in bug entry and
editing forms. If the user enters an incomplete username, he'll get a list of
users that matched the given username.


Support for "Insiders"
----------------------

If the 'insidergroup' parameter is defined, a specific group of users can be
designated insiders who can designate comments and attachments as private to
other insiders. These comments and attachments will be invisible to other
users who are not members of the insiders group even if the bugs to which they
apply are visible. Other insiders will see the comments and attachments with a
visual tinting indicating that they are private.


Time Tracking
-------------

Controls for tracking time spent fixing bugs are included in the bug form for
members of the group specified by the 'timetrackinggroup' parameter. Any time
comments are added to the bug, members of the time tracking group can add an
amount of time they spent, and it's figured into the total and displayed at
the top of the bug. Shown in the bug are your original estimate, the amount of
time spent so far, the revised estimate of how much time is remaining, and
your gain/loss on the original estimate.


Authentication module/LDAP improvements
---------------------------------------

Bugzilla's authentication mechanisms have been modularized, making pluggable
authentication schemes for Bugzilla a reality. Both the existing database and
LDAP systems were ported as part of modularization process. Additionally, the
CGI portion of the backend was redesigned to allow for authentication from
other sources, including (theoretically) email, which will help Bug 94850.

As part of this conversion, LDAP logins now use Perl's standard Net::LDAP
module, which has no external library dependencies.


Improved localization support
-----------------------------

Bugzilla administrators can now configure which languages are supported by
their installations and automatically serve correct, localized content to
users based on the HTTP 'Accept-Language' header sent from users' browsers.

There are currently localized templates available for: Arabic, Belarusian,
Chinese, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil) Spanish (Spain
or Mexico) and Russian.  These localized template packs are third-party
contributions, may only be available for specific versions, and may not be
supported in the future. (https://www.bugzilla.org/download/#localizations)


Patch Viewer
------------

Viewing and reviewing patches in Bugzilla is often difficult due to lack of
context, improper format and the inherent readability issues that raw patches
present. Patch Viewer is an enhancement to Bugzilla designed to fix that by
offering increased context, linking to sections, and integrating with Bonsai,
LXR and CVS.


Comment Reply Links
-------------------

In Edit Bug, each bug comment now includes a convenient (reply) link that
quotes the comment text into the textarea. This feature is only enabled in
Javascript-capable browsers, but causes no inconvenience to other user agents.


Full-Text Search
----------------

It is now possible to query the Bugzilla database using full-text searching,
which spans comments and summaries, and which searches for substrings and stem
variations of the search term. Basically, it's like using Google.


Email Address Munging
---------------------

The fact that raw email addresses are displayed in Bugzilla makes it trivial
for bots that spamharvest to spider through Bugzilla, in particular, through
Bugzilla's buglists. This change adds HTML obfuscation of email addresses as
they appear in the Bugzilla web pages.


Google-like Bug Search
----------------------

Bugzilla now includes a very simple, Google-like "Find a Specific Bug" page,
in addition to its advanced search page.


Miscellaneous Improvements
--------------------------

- The "Assigned To" field on the new bug page is now prefilled with the default
  component owner.

- A bug alias column is now available in the buglist page.

- Lists of bugs containing errors in the sanity check page now have a "view as
  buglist" link in addition to the individual bug links.

- Autolinkification Page - It's now possible to apply Bugzilla's comment
  hyperlinking algorithm to any text you like. This should be useful for status
  updates and other web pages which give lists of bugs. The bug links created
  include the subject, status and resolution of the bug as a tooltip.

- There are more <link> tags on the links toolbar for navigating quickly between
  different areas.

- Buglists are now available as comma-separated value files (CSV) and JavaScript
  (JS) as well as HTML and RDF.

- Keywords and dependencies can now be entered during initial bug entry.

- A CSS id signature unique to each Bugzilla installation is now added to the
  <body> tag on Bugzilla pages to allow custom end-user CSS to explicitly affect
  Bugzilla.

- Perl's path has been changed to a normal /usr/bin/perl from the original
  legacy "bonsaitools" path specifier.

- A new "always-require-login" parameter allows administrators to require a
  login before being able to view any page, except the front page.

- A developer may add an attachment, and also reassign a bug to himself as part
  of that single action.

- Bugzilla is now able to use the replication facilities provided by the
  MySQL database to handle updates from the main database to the secondaries.

- Mail handling is now between 125&#37; to 175&#37; faster.

- Guided Bug Entry: You can see a sample enter_bug.cgi template at 
  enter_bug.cgi?format=guided that "guides" users through the process of 
  filing a "good" bug. It needs to be modified before use in your organization.

- There is now a "Give me some help" link on the Advanced Search page that will
  enable pop-up help for every field on the page.

- The Bugzilla administrator can now forbid users from marking bugs RESOLVED 
  when there are unresolved dependencies.


All Changes
-----------

To see a list of EVERY bug that was fixed between 2.16 and 2.18 (over 1000),
see: http://tinyurl.com/6m3e4


What's Changed?
***************


Flag names
----------

Prerelease versions of Bugzilla 2.17 and 2.18 inadvertantly allowed
commas and spaces in the names of flags, which due to the way they're
processed, caused lots of internal havoc if you named flags to have
any commas or spaces in them.  Having commas or spaces in the names
can cause errors in the notification emails and in the bug activity
log.  The ability to create new flags with these characters has been
removed.  If you have any existing flags that you named that way,
running checksetup will attempt to automatically rename them by
replacing commas and spaces with underscores.


New Saved Search User Interface
-------------------------------

In previous Bugzilla versions, you could specify on the search page that you 
wanted to save a search and store it as a link in your footer. This option has
now moved to the search results page (buglist.cgi), where you will see a 
"Remember search" button with a box next to it to enter the name of the search.

You can manage your saved searches on the Preferences page.


Rules for changing fields
-------------------------

There have been some changes to the rules governing who can change which fields
of a bug report.  The rules for Bugzilla version 2.16 and 2.18, along with
differences between them, are listed below.  Bear in mind that there are other
restrictions on bug manipulation besides the ones listed below.  In particular,
the groups system enforces restrictions on who can create, edit, or even see
any given bug.

Bugzilla 2.16 rules:

- anyone can make a null change;
- anyone can add a comment;
- anyone in the editbugs group can make any change;
- the reporter can make any change to the status;
- anyone in the canconfirm group can change the status
  to any opened state (NEW, REOPENED, ASSIGNED).
- anyone can change the status to any opened state
  if the everconfirmed flag is set;
- the owner, QA contact, or reporter can make any change
  *except* changing the status to an opened state;
- No other changes are permitted.

[Note that these rules combine to allow the reporter to make any change
to the bug.]

Bugzilla 2.18 rules:

- anyone can make a null change;
- anyone can add a comment;
- anyone in the editbugs group can make any change;
- anyone in the canconfirm group can change the status
  from UNCONFIRMED to any opened state;
- the owner or QA contact can make any change;
- the reporter can make any change *except*:
  - changing the status from UNCONFIRMED to any opened state; or
  - changing the target milestone; or
  - changing the priority (unless the letsubmitterchoosepriority
    parameter is set).
- No other changes are permitted.

The effective differences in the rules:

- In 2.16, the reporter could always change anything about a bug.

  In 2.18, the reporter can't:

  - confirm the bug unless he is in the canconfirm group;
  - change the target milestone;
  - change the priority (unless the 'letsubmitterchoosepriority'
    parameter is set;

  (unless he is also the owner, the QA contact, or in the editbugs
  group, in which case he can do all these things).

- In 2.16, the owner or QA contact (if the 'useqacontact' parameter
  is set) can't change the bug status to an opened status unless they
  are also the reporter, or have editbugs or canconfirm, or the
  everconfirmed flag is set on the bug).

  In 2.18 the owner or QA contact can make any change to a bug.

- In 2.16, a member of the canconfirm group can set the status
  to any opened status.

  In 2.18 this is only possible if the status was previously
  the unconfirmed status.

- In 2.16, the status can be set to anything by anybody
  if the 'everconfirmed' flag is set.

  In 2.18, this authorization code does not pay any attention
  to the 'everconfirmed' flag.


Removed Features
****************

- Please note that Bugzilla no longer supports MySQL 3.22. The minimum required
  version is now 3.23.41.                                      

- The "shadow database" mechanism is no longer used. Instead, use MySQL's 
  built-in replication feature.

- If you have placed any comments in the localconfig file, they may be removed
  by checksetup.pl.


Code Changes Which May Affect Customizations
********************************************

- A mechanism (called "Template Hooks") for third party extensions to plug into
  existing templates without having to patch or replace distributed templates
  has been added. More information on this can be found in the documentation.

- Header output now uses CGI.pm, in a step towards enabling mod_perl
  compatibility. This change will affect users that had customized charsets in
  their CGI files: previously the charset had to be added everywhere that
  printed the Content-Type header; now it only needs changing in one spot, in
  Bugzilla/CGI.pm.

- $::FORM{} and $::COOKIE{} are deprecated. Use the $cgi methods to access
  them.

- $::userid is gone in favor of Bugzilla->user->id

- ConnectToDatabase() is gone (it's done automatically when you initialize the
  Bugzilla object)

- quietly_check_login() and confirm_login() are gone, use Bugzilla->login()
  with parameters for whether the login is required or not.

- Use Bugzilla->user->login in place of $::COOKIE{Bugzilla_login}

- You can tell if there's a user logged in or not by using
  Bugzilla->user rather than looking for $::userid==0.
  In new 2.18 code, use defined(Bugzilla->user) && (Bugzilla->user->id)
  In 2.20, this will become just (Bugzilla->user->id)
  In templates, always test [&#37; IF user.id &#37;] rather than [&#37; IF user &#37;]

- SendSQL() and related calls are deprecated, and the various $dbh methods 
  should be used instead, such as $dbh->prepare() and $dbh->execute(). 
  Bugzilla->dbh is the $dbh handle to use.


Recommended Practice for the Upgrade
************************************

Note About Upgrading From MySQL With ISAM Tables
------------------------------------------------
As previously noted in the Dependency Requirements MySQL is now required 
to be at least version 3.23.41.  This implies that all tables of type ISAM will 
be converted by the checksetup.pl script to MyISAM.


Steps for Upgrading
-------------------

1) View the Sanity Check (sanitycheck.cgi) page on your installation before
   upgrading.

2) As with any upgrade it is recommended that you make a backup of the 
   Bugzilla database before you upgrade, perhaps by using mysqldump.

   Example:

      mysqldump -u root -p --databases bugs > bugs.db.backup

3) Replace the files in your installation, or you can try to use CVS to upgrade.
   The Bugzilla.org website has instructions on how to do the actual 
   installation.

4) Make sure that you run checksetup.pl after you install the new version.

5) View the Sanity Check page again after you run checksetup.pl.

6) It is recommended that, if possible, you fix any problems you find
   immediately. Failure to do this may mean that Bugzilla will not work 
   correctly. Be aware that if the sanity check page contains more errors after
   an upgrade, it doesn't necessarily mean there are more errors in your 
   database, as additional tests are added to the sanity check over time, and 
   it is possible that those errors weren't being checked for in the old 
   version.


Outstanding Issues
******************

These are known problems with the release that we think you should know about. 
They each have a bug number for https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/

- If at any time you upgraded from a version of Bugzilla between 2.17.4 -
  2.17.7 to either 2.18rc3 or 2.19.1, you must manually fix your New Charts in
  order for them to work. See the following link for instructions on how to do
  this: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=276237#c18
  If you are using 2.18rc3, but did not upgrade from version 2.17.4 or newer,
  then you don't need to do this.

- bug 37765: If you use an MTA other than sendmail (such as Postfix, Exim, 
  etc.) you MUST turn on the "sendmailnow" parameter or Bugzilla will not send
  e-mail correctly.

- bug 276230: The support for restricting access to particular Categories of 
  New Charts is not complete. You should treat the 'chartgroup' Param as the 
  only access mechanism available. However, additionally, charts migrated from
  Old Charts will be restricted to the groups that are marked MANDATORY for 
  the corresponding Product. There is currently no way to change this 
  restriction, and the groupings will not be updated if the group configuration
  for the Product changes.

- bug 69621: If you rename or remove a keyword that is in use on bugs, you will
  need to rebuild the "keyword cache" by running sanitycheck.cgi and choosing
  the option to rebuild the cache when it asks. Otherwise keywords may not show
  up properly in search results.

- (No Bug Number) If you have a lot of non-ASCII data in your Bugzilla (for 
  example, if you use a translation of Bugzilla), don't enable the XS::Stash
  option when you install the Template Toolkit, or your Bugzilla installation
  may become slow. This problem is fixed in a not-yet-released version of the
  Template Toolkit (after 2.14).

- bug 266579: Users may be able to circumvent not having "canconfirm" privileges
  in some circumstances. This is fixed starting with 2.19.3, but will not
  be fixed in any 2.18 release, as the changes required to fix it are quite
  large.

- bug 99215: Attachment changes have no mid-air collision detection, unlike bug
  changes.

- bug 57350: Searching using the "commenter is" option may be VERY slow. Note 
  that searching for "field: comment, changed by: user@domain.com" is fast, 
  though.

- bug 151509: Using the boolean chart option "contains the string" with the 
  "flag name" field or certain other fields will cause Bugzilla to emit an 
  error. This is fixed in 2.20rc1, but will not be fixed in the 2.18 series.

- bug 234159: Bugzilla may sometimes send multiple notices in one email.

- bug 237107: If you search for attachment information using the Boolean Charts
  at the bottom of the Advanced Query page, bugs without attachments will not
  show up in the result list.


Security Fixes In 2.18 Releases
*******************************

Version 2.18
------------

Summary:     XSS in Internal Error messages in Bugzilla 2.16.7 and 2.18rc3
CVE Name:    CAN-2004-1061
Reference:   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=272620
Details:
     It is possible to send a carefully crafted URL to Bugzilla designed to
trigger an error message.  The Internal Error message includes javascript code
which displays the URL the user is visiting.  The javascript code does not
escape the URL before displaying it, allowing scripts contained in the URL to
be executed by the browser.  Many browsers do not allow unescaped URLs to be
sent to a webserver (thus complying with RFC 2616 section 2.3.1 and RFC 2396
section 2.4.3), and are thus immune to this issue.
    Browsers which are known to be immune: Firefox 1.0, Mozilla 1.7.5,
Camino 0.8.2, Netscape 7.2, Safari 1.2.4
     Browsers known to be susceptible: Internet Explorer 6 SP2,
Konqueror 3.2
     Browsers not listed here have not been tested.


Version 2.18.1
--------------

Two security issues were fixed in Bugzilla 2.18.1, neither of them 
critical.

See https://www.bugzilla.org/security/2.16.8/ for details.


Version 2.18.2
--------------

Two security issues were fixed in Bugzilla 2.18.2. One of them
is a major Information Leak/Unauthorized Bug Change. The other
is a minor Information Leak.

See https://www.bugzilla.org/security/2.18.1/ for details.


Detailed Version-To-Version Release Notes
*****************************************

*********************************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM ALL VERSIONS PRIOR TO 2.16.7 ***
*********************************************************

*** Security fixes ***

- It is possible to send a carefully crafted HTTP POST message to
  process_bug.cgi which will remove keywords from a bug even if you don't have
  permissions to edit all bug fields (the "editbugs" permission).  Such changes
  are reported in "bug changed" email notifications, so they are easily
  detected and reversed if someone abuses it.  Users are now prevented from
  making changes to keywords if they do not have editbugs privileges. (bug
  252638)

*** Bug fixes of note ***

- Enforce a minimum of 10 minutes between attempts to reset a password, so
  we don't mailbomb the user if someone submits the form many times in a
  row. (bug 250897)

- Put products in alphabetical order on the create attachment status page.
  (bug 251427)

- Specify MyISAM as the table type when creating new tables.  MySQL 4.1 and
  up default to InnoDB, which doesn't support some of the indexing methods
  that we use. (bug 263165)

*********************************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM ALL VERSIONS PRIOR TO 2.16.6 ***
*********************************************************

*** Security fixes ***

- If Bugzilla is configured to hide entire products from some users, both
  duplicates.cgi and the form for mass-editing a list of bugs in buglist.cgi
  can disclose the names of those hidden products to such users.
  (bugs 234825 and 234855)

- Several administration CGIs echo invalid data back to the user without
  escaping it.  (bug 235265)

- A user with privileges to grant membership to any group (i.e. usually an
  administrator) can trick editusers.cgi into executing arbitrary SQL.
  (bug 244272)

*** Bug fixes of note ***

- Allow XML import to function when there are regexp metacharacters in product
  names (bug 237591) 

- Allow the bug_email.pl contrib script to work with useqacontact (bug 239912) 

- Improve the error message used by checksetup.pl when the MySQL requirements
  are not met (bug 240228) 

- Elimnate the warning in checksetup.pl about the minimum sendmail version (bug
  240060) 

- $webservergroup now defaults to group 'apache' in new installations (bug
  224477)

- Correct a situation where a bugmail message could be sent twice to a user
  being added to the CC list if the address was entered in a different case
  than the user registered with.  (bug 117297)

- Various documentation updates

*** Bug fixes of note ***

- Fix a "used only once" warning that ocurred only in perl 5.00503
  (bug 2321691)

- When a user is creating a new account and enters an invalid email
  address, the error page sent the "Content-type" header twice, causing
  the second one to be visible at the top of the page.
  (bug 137121)

- An HTML encoding issue which only affected Internet Explorer was
  corrected in the "Change several bugs at once" page.
  (bug 181106)
 
- During initial setup, using invalid characters in the administrator
  password would present an error message stating your password was
  too long or too short instead of telling you it had invalid
  characters.
  (bug 166755)

- When a user reset their own password via an emailed token, the new
  password in the first field would be accepted if the second password
  field was left blank.
  (bug 123077)

- Reopening bugs from the "change several bugs at once" page now works.
  (bug 95430)

- Fix a regression in xml.cgi caused by the previous bugfix for MySQL
  SUM() changes.  The original fix didn't work properly either.
  (bug 225474)

- No longer use server push with the "Safari" browser, which claims to
  use the Mozilla layout engine but doesn't.
  (bug 188712)

- Creating a shadow database no longer fails with taint mode errors.
  (bug 227510)
  
- If you change your cookiepath setting at some stage (because you have
  moved the directory Bugzilla resides on your webserver), users can
  have login cookies with the old cookiepath, and their browsers will
  send multiple logincookies.  Bugzilla now uses the first rather than
  the last in order to get the most specific cookie which will be the
  correct one.
  (bug 121419)	
  
- Fixed a regression caused by the previous DBD::mysql fixes, that
  caused older versions of DBD::mysql to break due to not supporting
  the new DBI syntax.
  (bug 224815)

- Bugzilla no longer sends out invalid dates for cookie expiry.  This
  bug had no known user visible ramifications.
  (bug 228706)
  
- Update the shadow database parameters description to tell the user
  about permissions requirements for creating a shadow database.
  (bug 227513)

- Various documentation updates.

*********************************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM ALL VERSIONS PRIOR TO 2.16.3 ***
*********************************************************

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- A user with 'editproducts' privileges (i.e. usually an administrator)
  can select arbitrary SQL to be run by the nightly statistics cron job
  (collectstats.pl), by giving a product a special name.
  (bug 214290)

- A user with 'editkeywords' privileges (i.e. usually an administrator)
  can inject arbitrary SQL via the URL used to edit an existing keyword.
  (bug 219044)

- When deleting products and the 'usebuggroups' parameter is on, the
  privilege which allows someone to add people to the group which is
  being deleted does not get removed, allowing people with that
  privilege to get that privilege for the next group that is created
  which reuses that group ID.  Note that this only allows someone who
  had been granted privileges in the past to retain them.
  (bug 219690)

- If you know the email address of someone who has voted on a secure
  bug, you can access the summary of that bug even if you do not have
  sufficient permissions to view the bug itself.
  (bug 209376)

*** Bug fixes of note ***

Perl 5.8.0 Compatibility fixes:

- Two taint errors were fixed, one in process_bug.cgi, and 
  another in post_bug.cgi.
  (bugs 220332 and 177828)

MySQL 4.0 Compatibility fixes:

- A cosmetic fix was applied to votes.cgi (if there were no 
  votes, the "0" was not displayed) due to a change in semantics 
  in SUM() in MySQL 4.0.
  (bug 217422)

DBD::mysql > 2.1026 Compatibility fixes:

- DBD::mysql versions after 2.1026 return the table list quoted, which
  broke the existing "table exists" check in checksetup.pl, which caused
  the second and subsequent attempts to run checksetup.pl to fail.
  (bug 212095) 

Miscellaneous bug fixes:

- A Mozilla-specific reference was removed from one of the report
  templates.
  (bug 221626)

- It was possible to enter a situation where you were unable to get to
  editparams.cgi to turn the shutdownhtml param back off after you
  turned it on when Apache was configured to run Bugzilla in suexec
  mode.
  (bug 213384)
  
- The processmail rescanall task would not send e-mails about more than
  one bug to the same address.
  (bug 219508)

- If Bugzilla hadn't been accessed in the last hour when the
  collectstats.pl or whineatnews.pl cron jobs ran, the versioncache
  would get recreated with the file owner being the user the cron job
  was running as (usually not the webserver user), causing subsequent
  access to Bugzilla by the webserver to fail until the permissions were
  fixed. Now if versioncache isn't readable when accessing from the
  webserver, we pretend it doesn't exist and recreate it again.
  (bug 160422)

- The 'sendmailnow' param is now on by default in new installations
  (this does not affect existing installations).
  (bug 146087)

- The 008filter.t test would fail if you had multiple language packs
  installed. It now properly tests all of the installed language packs.
  (bug 203318)

- A few minor documentation changes were committed.

*********************************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM ALL VERSIONS PRIOR TO 2.16.2 ***
*********************************************************

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- A cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was fixed in which bug 
  summaries were not properly filtered when a user viewed a dependency graph 
  allowing JavaScript to be embedded on that page.
  (bug 192661)
  
- Several XSS vulnerabilities were fixed in which user
  input was not escaped when being displayed. A new 
  test has been added to warn about unfiltered data in template
  files (t/008filter.t).
  (bug 192677)

- An issue was fixed in which the QA contact was still treated as the QA
  contact even after the 'useqacontact' setting was turned off. This also
  allowed the QA contact to edit the security groups and view secured bugs that
  he/she was allowed to access prior to the 'useqacontact' setting being
  deactivated.
  (bug 194394)
  
- Fixed a situation where an attacker (with local access to the webserver)
  could overwrite any file on the webserver to which the webserver user
  has write access by creating appropriately named symbolic links in the
  data and webdot directories (world-writable in many configurations).
  Bugzilla now uses File::Temp to create secure temporary files.  File::Temp
  is part of the Perl distribution for Perl 5.6.1 and later, but if you're
  using an older version of Perl you'll need to install it with CPAN.
  (bug 197153)

** IMPORTANT CHANGES ***

- New module requirement: File::Temp, as mentioned above.

*** Bug fixes of note ***

- An issue was fixed in which administrator rights could be removed from an
  administrator who deleted a product while the 'usebuggroups' setting is
  activated.
  (bug 157704) 
  
- Fixed an issue in which importxml.pl would fail the test suite when running
  under perl 5.8.0 with the optional XML::Parse module. 
  (bug 172331)
  
- There was previously a bug in CGI.pl in which the following warning 
  would be given under certain conditions: 
  "Character in "c" format wrapped at CGI.pl..." 
  This is now fixed. In some cases the warning was filling up web server log
  files.
  (bug 194125)
  
- Fixed a bug in which long component names (in excess of 50 characters) would
  be accepted when creating the component but would cause problems when trying
  to use that component on a bug because it would get truncated. It is now no
  longer possible to create components with names in excess of 50 characters. 
  (bug 197180)
  
- Fixed a bug in checksetup.pl in which permissions were not being fixed 
  on the 'data/comments' file, the quip file. 
  (bug 160279)

*****************************************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM 2.16.1 OR EARLIER, 2.14.4 OR EARLIER ***
*****************************************************************

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- Fixed a cross site scriptability issue in quips.  This is only a problem
  if quips with HTML could have been inserted into your quips files.  Bugzilla
  has not allowed this since 2.12.
  (bug 179329)
- checksetup.pl will now attempt to prevent access to "editor backups" of
  localconfig.
  (bug 186383)
- collectstats.pl no longer makes data/mining (which contains graphing
  information) world writeable.
  (bug 183188)

***********************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM 2.16.0 OR EARLIER  ***
***********************************************

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- Apostrophes were not properly handled in email addresses.  This was a
  regression introduced in 2.16.  It is not known whether this was
  exploitable.
  (bug 165221)

See also next major section.

*** Bug fixes of note ***

- The VERSION cookie which allowed the previously entered version of a product
  to be remembered was not correctly set.  It was only set as a session
  cookie, and under some circumstances could interfere with other cookies
  (such as the login information) send at the same time.
  (bug 160227)

- importxml.pl would fail if the versioncache needed to be updated.
  (bug 164464)

- Bug changes going through intermediate pages would munge fields with
  multiple fields, such as CCs.
  (bug 161203)

- On failure in template->new, Bugzilla will now die rather than futilely
  attempt to use an error template.
  (bug 166023)

- Fixed a problem where checksetup had problems converting old installations
  that didn't have a duplicates table.
  (bug 151619)

- Fixed a problem that caused taint errors when viewing or editing user
  preferences with Perl 5.005 and Template 2.08.
  (bug 160710)

See also next section.

******************************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM 2.16.0, 2.14.3 OR EARLIER ***
******************************************************

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- When a new product is added to an installation with 47 groups or more and
  "usebuggroups" is enabled, the new group will be assigned a groupset bit
  using Perl math that is not exact beyond 2^48.  This results in the new
  group being defined with a "bit" that has several bits set.  As users are
  given access to the new group, those users will also gain access to
  spurious lower group privileges.  Also, group bits were not always reused
  when groups were deleted.
  (bug 167485)

- The email interface had another insecure single parameter system call.  This
  could potentially allow arbitrary shell commands to be run.  This file is
  not supported at this time, but as long as we knew about the problem, we
  couldn't overlook it.
  (bug 163024)

*** Bug fixes of note ***

- The email interface was broken.  This was a 2.14.3 regression.  This file
  is not supported at this time, but as long as we knew about the problem, we
  couldn't overlook it.
  (bug 160631)

***********************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM 2.14.5 OR EARLIER  ***
***********************************************

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- The bug reporter could set the priority even when
  'letsubmitterchoosepriority' was off.
  (bug 63018)

- Most CGIs are now templatised.  This helps to make it
  easier to remember to HTML filter values and easier to spot
  when they are not, preventing cross site scripting attacks.
  (bug 86168)

- Most CGIs now run in taint mode.  This helps to prevent
  failure to validate errors.
  (bug 108982)

*** IMPORTANT CHANGES ***

- 2.16 introduces "templatisation", a new feature that allows
  administrators to easily customise the HTML output (the "look and feel")
  of Bugzilla without altering Perl code.  Bugzilla uses the
  "Template Toolkit" for this.  Please see the "Template Customisation"
  section of the Bugzilla Guide for more details.

  Administrators who ran the 2.15 development version and customised
  templates should check the templates are still valid, as file names
  and file paths have changed.

  Most output is now templatised.  This process will be complete next
  milestone.

  For speed, compiled templates are cached on disk.  If you modify the
  templates, the toolkit will normally detect the changes, and recompile the
  changed templates.

  Adding new directories anywhere inside the template directory may cause 
  permission errors if you don't have a webservergroup specified in
  localconfig.  If you see these, rerun checksetup.pl as root.  If you do not
  have root access, or cannot get someone who does to do this for you, you can
  rename the data/template directory to data/template.old (or any other name
  Bugzilla doesn't use).  Then rerun checksetup.pl to regenerate the compiled
  templates.
  (bug 86168, 97832)

- Administrators can now configure maximum attachment sizes.  These
  should remain below the maximum size for your MySQL server, or you
  will get obscure MySQL errors if you attach a bigger attachment.

  To find out the current size attachment that MySQL can accept, type
  the command 'mysqladmin variables' and find out the value of the
  'max_allowed_packet' varible in bytes.

  To change the maximum size that MySQL can accept you can alter this
  variable in your 'my.cnf' file.
  (bug 91664)

- Perl 5.004 is no longer supported because the Template Toolkit
  requires 5.005.
  (bug 97721)

- New module requirements: Text::Wrap, Template [requires AppConfig],
                           File::Spec.
  (bugs 97784, 84338, 103778)

- The index page is now a CGI instead of an HTML page.  You should remove
  any existing index.html file and make sure your web server allows index.cgi
  to be the default page in a directory.  If you are not able to do that you
  can instead set index_html in the 'localconfig' file to 1 and checksetup.pl
  will create a redirect page for you.
  (bug 80183)

- It is now recommended that administrators run "processmail rescanall"
  after upgrading to 2.16 or beyond.

  This will send out notification emails for changes that were
  made but not emailed, due to Bugzilla bugs.  All known
  causes of this have been fixed in this version (bug 104589 and 99519).

  It is also recommended that this be run nightly to avoid
  lengthy delays in future if this problem reoccurs.
  (bug 106377)

- In parallel with templatisation, a lot of changes have been made to the HTML
  output of the Bugzilla CGIs.  This could break code that attempts to parse
  such code.  For example, this breaks mozbot.
  (no bug number)

- The "HTML template" parameters (headerhtml, bodyhtml, footerhtml,
  errorhtml, bannerhtml, blurbhtml, mostfreqhtml, entryheaderhtml) have now
  been moved to Template Toolkit templates.  If you have modified these
  parameters you will need to make corresponding changes to the corresponding
  templates.  Your old parameter values will be moved to a file called
  old-params.txt by checksetup.pl.

  The old parameters correspond to files in template/en/default as follows:

  headerhtml:      global/header.html.tmpl
  footerhtml:      global/footer.html.tmpl
  bannerhtml:      global/banner.html.tmpl
  blurbhtml:       global/banner.html.tmpl
  mostfreqhtml:    reports/duplicates*.html.tmpl
  entryheaderhtml: bug/create/user-message.html.tmpl

  (bug 140437)

*** Other changes of note ***

- The query page has been redesigned for better user friendliness.
  (bug 98707)
- Users can now change their email account.
  (bug 23067)
- "Dependent Bug Changed" notification emails now contain the
  dependent bug's summary and URL.
  (bug 28736, 113383)
- Bugs with severity "critical", "blocker", and "enhancement" are
  visually differentiated on bug lists for browsers with sufficient
  CSS support.
  (bug 28884)
- Bugzilla now has a sidebar for the Mozilla browser.
  (bug 37339)
- A link to just created attachments now appears in notification
  email.
  (bug 66651)
- Comments now have numbers and can be referenced with
  autohyperlinkifying similar to bugs.
  (bug 71840)
- The attachment system has been rewritten, supporting new
  "attachment statuses" (like keywords, but for attachments),
  the ability to obsolete attachments, edit attachment MIME type,
  and edit whether the attachment is a patch.
  (bugs 84338, 75176)
- syncshadowdb now supports a configurable temp file location,
  and properly shuts down Bugzilla while running.
  (bug 75840)
- Dependency tree now lets you exclude resolved bugs and bugs
  below a specified depth.
  (bugs 83058)
- The "strictvaluechecks" parameter has gone away.  These checks
  are now always done.
  (bug 119715)
- The midair collision page now shows all changes since the bug
  page was loaded, not just the last one.
  (bug 108312)
- Added support for making dependency graphs with 'dot', which
  is better at creating complex graphs than 'webdot'.
  (bug 120537)

*** Bug fixes of note ***

- Bugzilla scripts are now usually not terminated when the browser
  window they are running in is closed.  This caused hard to
  reproduce bugs.
  (bug 104589)
- On browsers that "reflow" the page, large component / milestone /
  version fields were extremely slow to reflow when you altered
  the product field.
  (bug 96534)
- The selection in the component / milestone / version fields is
  no longer lost when you change the selection in the product
  field or use the back/forward buttons in your browser to return
  to the page.
  (bug 97966)
- You could not reverse dependencies in one step.
  (bug 82143)
- Mass reassignment of non-open bugs will no longer reopen them.
  (bug 30731)
- Attempting to bulk change no bugs will now give a user-friendly
  error message.
  (bug 90333)
- If you make a change to a bug where you only add yourself to CC,
  email notifications are now properly sent out for MySQL 3.23.
  (bug 99519)
- Bug entry now properly validates the data it has been sent.
  (bug 107743)
- Midair collision checks will now properly work in all situations
  where dependencies have changed.
  (bug 73502)
- Browsers can no longer corrupt the params file if they use the "wrong"
  end-of-line markers.
  (bug 92500)
- The MySQL port defined in localconfig is now properly honoured.
  (bug 98368)
- Apostrophes in component/milestone/version names no longer cause
  a problem on the query page.
  (bug 30689/42810)
- File attachment comments will now wrap.
  (bug 52060)
- Saved queries are no longer mangled if you need to log in again,
  for example if you had cookies off.
  (bug 38835)
- Bug counts (on reports.cgi) were very slow if you had to
  count a lot of bugs.
  (bug 63249)
- 2.14 introduced options to let people see a bug when their name
  is on it but who aren't in the groups the bug is restricted
  to.  These only allowed the people to view the bugs directly,
  and not see them on buglists and receive email about them.
  (bugs 95024, 97469)
- A new 'cookiepath' parameter on editparams.cgi allows multiple
  Bugzilla installations to exist on one host without problems.
  (bug 19910)
- whineatnews.pl now respects the 'sendmailnow' parameter.
  (bug 52782)
- The query page came up even when Bugzilla was shut down.
  (bug 121747)
- Quicksearch gave a weird error message when Bugzilla was
  shut down.
  (bug 121741)
- Operating system detection fixes.
  (bugs 92763, 135666)
- QA contacts now receive emails when a new bug is created and
  their only email preference was being added or removed from QA.

  (bug 154008)

*** Bug fixes of note ***

- The fix for bug 130821 in 2.14.2 broke being able to sort

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- queryhelp.cgi no longer shows confidential products to
  people it shouldn't.
  (bug 126801)

- It was possible for a user to bypass the IP check by
  setting up a fake reverse DNS, if the Bugzilla web server
  was configured to do reverse DNS lookups.  Apache is not
  configured as such by default.  This is not a complete
  exploit, as the user's login cookie would also need to
  be divulged for this to be a problem.
  (bug 129466)

- In some situations the data directory became world writeable.
  (bug 134575)

- Any user with access to editusers.cgi could delete a user
  regardless of whether 'allowuserdeletion' is on.
  (bug 141557)

- Real names were not HTML filtered, causing possible cross
  site scripting attacks.
  (bug 146447, 147486)

- Mass change would set the groupset of every bug to be the
  groupset of the first bug.
  (bug 107718)

- Some browsers (eg NetPositive) interacted with Bugzilla
  badly and could have various form problems, including
  removing group restrictions on bugs.
  (bug 148674)

- It was possible for random confidential information to be
  divulged, if the shadow database was in use and became

- The bug list sort order is now stricter about the SQL it will accept,
  ensuring you use correct column name syntax.  Before this, there were
  some syntax checks, so it is not known whether this problem was
  exploitable.
  (bug 130821)

********************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM 2.14 OR EARLIER ***
********************************************

The 2.14.1 release fixes several security issues that became
known to us after the Bugzilla 2.14 release.

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- If LDAP Authentication was being used, Bugzilla would allow
  you to log in as anyone if you left the password blank.
  (bug 54901)

- It was possible to add comments or file a bug as someone else
  by editing the HTML on the appropriate submission page before
  submitting the form.  User identity is checked now, and the
  form values suggesting the user are now ignored.
  (bug 108385, 108516)

- The Product popup menu on the show_bug form listed all
  products, even if the user didn't have access to all of them.
  It now only shows products the user has access to (and the
  product the bug is in, if the user is viewing it because of
  some other override).
  (bug 102141)

- If a user had any blessgroupset privileges (the ability to
  change only specific privileges for other users), it was
  possible to change your own groupset (privileges) by
  altering the page HTML before submitting on editusers.cgi.
  (bug 108821)

- An untrusted variable was echoed back to user in the HTML
  output if there was a login error while editing votes.
  (bug 98146)

- buglist.cgi had an undocumented parameter that allowed you
  to pass arbitrary SQL for the "WHERE" part of a query.
  This has been disabled.
  (bug 108812)

- It was possible for a user to send arbitrary SQL by inserting
  single quotes in the "mybugslink" field in the user
  preferences.
  (bug 108822)

- buglist.cgi was not validating that the field names being
  passed from the "boolean chart" query form were valid field
  names, thus allowing arbitrary SQL to be inserted if you 
  edited the HTML by hand before submitting the form.
  (bug 109679)

- long_list.cgi was not validating that the bug ID parameter
  was actually a number, allowing arbitrary SQL to be inserted
  if you edited the HTML by hand.

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- Multiple instances of unauthorised access to confidential
  bugs has been fixed.
  (bug 39524, 39526, 39527, 39531, 39533, 70189, 82781)

- Multiple instances of untrusted parameters not being
  checked/escaped was fixed.  These included definite security
  holes.
  (bug 38854, 38855, 38859, 39536, 87701, 95235)

- After logging in passwords no longer appear in the URL.
  (bug 15980)

- Procedures to prevent unauthorised access to confidential
  files are now simpler.  In particular the shadow directory
  no longer exists and the data/comments file no longer needs
  to be directly accessible, so the entire data directory can
  be blocked.  However, no changes are required here if you
  have a properly secured 2.12 installation as no new files
  must be protected.
  (bug 71552, 73191)

- If they do not already exist, checksetup.pl will attempt to
  write Apache .htaccess files by default, to prevent
  unauthorised access to confidential files.  You can turn this
  off in the localconfig file.
  (bug 76154)

- Sanity check can now only be run by people in the 'editbugs'
  group.  Although it would be better to have a separate
  group, this is not possible until the limitation on the
  number of groups allowed has been removed.
  (bug 54556)

- The password is no longer stored in plaintext form.  It will
  be eradicated next time you run checksetup.pl.  A user must
  now change their password via a password change request that
  gets validated at their e-mail account, rather than have it
  mailed to them.
  (bug 74032)

- When you are using product groups and you move a bug between
  products (single or mass change), the bug will no longer be
  restricted to the old product's group (if it was) and will
  be restricted to the new product's group.
  (bug 66235)

- There are now options on a bug to choose whether the
  reporter, and CCs can access a bug even if they aren't in
  groups the bug it is restricted to.
  (bug 39816)

- You can no longer mark a bug as a duplicate of a bug you
  can't see, and if you mark a bug a duplicate of a bug
  the reporter cannot see you will be given options as to
  what to do regarding adding the reporter of the resolved
  bug to the CC of the open bug.
  (bug 96085)

*** IMPORTANT CHANGES ***

- Bugzilla 2.14 no longer supports old email tech.  Upon
  upgrading, all users will be moved over to new email tech.
  This should speed up upgrading for installations with
  a large number of bugs.
  (bug 71552)

- There is new functionality for people to see why they are
  receiving notification mails.

  Previously, some people filtered old email tech
  notifications depending on whether they were in the To or the
  CC header, in order to get a limited way of determining why
  they were receiving the notification for filtering purposes.

  Existing installations will need to make changes to support
  this feature.  The receive reasons can be added to the
  notifications as a header and/or in the body.  To add these
  you will need to modify your newchangedmail parameter on
  editparams.cgi, either by resetting it or appropriately
  modifying it.  The header value is specified by
  &#37;reasonsheader&#37; and the body by &#37;reasonsbody&#37;.  For example,
  the new default parameter is:

  --------------------------------------------------
  From: bugzilla-daemon
  To: &#37;to&#37;
  Subject: [Bug &#37;bugid&#37;] &#37;neworchanged&#37;&#37;summary&#37;
  X-Bugzilla-Reason: &#37;reasonsheader&#37;

  &#37;urlbase&#37;show_bug.cgi?id=&#37;bugid&#37;

  &#37;reasonsbody&#37;

  (bug 26194)

- Very long fields (especially multi-valued fields like keywords,
  CCs, dependencies) on bug activity and notifications previously
  could get truncated, resulting in useless notifications and data
  loss on bug activity.  Now the multi-valued fields only show
  changes, and very big changes are split into multiple lines.
  Where data loss has already occurred on bug activity, it is
  indicated using question marks.
  (bug 55161, 92266)

- Previously, when a product's voting preferences changed all
  votes were removed from all the bugs in the product.  Also,
  when a bug was moved to another product, all of its votes
  were removed.  This no longer occurs.

  Instead, if the action would leave one or more bugs with
  greater than the maximum number of votes per person per bug,
  the number of votes will be reduced to the maximum.  The
  person will still be notified of this as before.

  If the action would leave a user with more votes in a product
  than is allowed, the limit will be breached so as to not lose
  votes.  However the user will not be able to update their
  votes except to fix this situation.  No further action is taken
  in this version to make sure that the user does this.
  (bug 28882, 92593)

*** Other changes of note ***

- Groups can now be marked inactive, so you can't add a new
  restriction on that group to a bug, while leaving bugs that
  were previously restricted on that group alone.
  (bug 75482)
- backdoor.cgi has been removed from the installation.  It was
  old code that was Netscape-specific and its name was scaring
  people.
  (bug 87983)
- You can now add or remove from CC on the bulk change page.
  (bug 12819)
- New users created by administrators are now automatically
  inserted into groups according to the group's regular
  expression.  Administrators must edit the user in a second
  step to override these choices.  Previously the
  administrator specified these explicitly which could lead
  to incorrect settings.
  (bug 45164)
- The userregexp of system groups can now be edited without
  resorting to direct database access.
  (bug 65290)

*** Bug fixes of note ***

- The bug list page was sometimes bringing up a not logged in
  footer when the user was logged in and the installation was
  using a shadow database.
  (bug 47914)
- You can now view the bug summary in your browser title for
  a group-restricted bug if you have proper permissions.
  (bug 71767)
- Quick search for search terms did not work in IE5.
  This has been worked around.
  (bug 77699)
- Quick search for search terms crashed NN4.76/4.77 for Unix.
  This has been worked around.
  (bug 83619)
- Queries on bugs you have commented on using the "added
  comment" feature should be a lot faster and not time out
  on large installations due to the addition of an index.
  (bug 57350)
- You can now alter group settings on bulk change for groups
  that aren't on for all bugs or off for all bugs.
  (bug 84714)
- New bug notifications now include the CC and QA fields.
  (bug 28458)
- Bugzilla is now more Windows friendly, although it is still
  not an official platform.
  (bug 88179, 29064)
- Passwords are now encrypted using Perl's encrypt function.
  This makes Bugzilla more portable to more operating systems.
  (bug 77473)
- Bugzilla didn't properly shut down when told to - some
  queries could still be sent to the database.
  (bug 95082)

********************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM 2.10 OR EARLIER ***
********************************************

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- Some security holes have been fixed where shell escape characters
  could be passed to Bugzilla, allowing remote users to execute
  system commands on the web server.

*** IMPORTANT CHANGES ***

- There is now a facility for users to choose the sort of
  notifications they wish to receive.  This facility will
  probably be improved in future versions.
  (bug 17464)

- "Changed" will no longer appear on the subject line of
  change notification emails.  Because of this, you should
  change the subject line in your 'changedmail' and
  'newchangedmail' params on editparams.cgi.  The subject
  line needs to be changed from

    Subject: [Bug &#37;bugid&#37;] &#37;neworchanged&#37; - &#37;summary&#37;

  to:

    Subject: [Bug &#37;bugid&#37;] &#37;neworchanged&#37;&#37;summary&#37;

  or whatever is appropriate for the subject you are using
  on your system.  Note the removal of the " - " in the
  middle.
  (bug 29820)

*** Other changes of note ***

- Bug titles now appear in the page title, and will hence
  display in the user's browser's bookmarks and history.
  (bug 22041)
- Edit groups functionality (editgroups.cgi).
  (bug 25010)
- Support for moving bugs to other Bugzilla databases.
  (bug 36133)
- Bugzilla now can generate a frequently reported bugs list
  based on what duplicates you receive.
  (bug 25693)
- When installing Bugzilla fresh, the administrator account is
  now created in checksetup.pl.
  (bug 17773)
- Stored queries now show their name above the bug list, which
  helps the user when they have multiple bug lists in multiple
  browser windows.  It also appears in the page title, and will
  hence display in the user's browser's bookmarks and history.
  (bug 52228)
- All states and resolutions can now be collected for charting.
  (bug 6682)
- A new search-engine-like "quick search" feature appears on
  the front page to try and making searching easier.
  (bug 69793)
- Querying on dependencies now works in the advanced query
  section of the query page.
  (bug 30823)
- When a bug is marked as a duplicate, the reporter of the
  resolved bug is automatically added to the CC list of the
  open bug.
  (bug 28676)

*** Bug fixes of note ***

- Notification emails will now always be sent to QA contacts.
  Previously they wouldn't if you were using new email tech.
  (bug 30826)
- When marking a bug as a duplicate, the duplicate stamp marked
  on the open bug will no longer be written too early (such as
  on mid-air collisions).
  (bug 7873)
- Various bug fixes were made to the initial assignee and QA
  of a component.  It is no longer possible to enter an
  invalid address.  They will also now properly update when
  a user's email address is changed.  Sanity check will now
  check these.
  (bug 66876)
- Administrators can no longer create an email accounts that do
  not match the global email regular expression parameter.
  Previously this could occur and would cause sanity check
  errors.
  (bug 32971)
- The resolution field can no longer become empty when the
  bug is resolved.  This occurred because of midair collisions.
  (bug 49306)
