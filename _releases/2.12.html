<h1>2.12 Release Notes</h1>
<pre>
There has not been a Bugzilla release for a while, but
development has continued, and the Bugzilla team is proud
to announce release of Bugzilla 2.12.

Recommended Practice For The Upgrade
------------------------------------

As always, please ensure you have ran checksetup.pl after
replacing the files in your installation.

It is recommended that you view the sanity check page
(sanitycheck.cgi) both before the upgrade and after running
checksetup.pl after the upgrade, to see if there are any
problems with your installation.

It is also recommended that if you can, you immediately fix
any problems you find.  Be aware that if the sanity check page
contains more errors after an upgrade, it doesn't necessarily
mean there are more errors in your database, as it is likely
they weren't being checked for in the old version.

New email tech for email notifications is now recommended.
Old email tech will probably be removed in Bugzilla 2.14.
It is strongly recommended that you turn on the newemailtech
and newemailtechdefault options on the Edit Parameters page
(editparams.cgi), so new accounts will use new email tech.

If you wish, you may move all old accounts over to new email
tech by executing the following SQL statement in MySQL:

    UPDATE profiles SET newemailtech = '1';

About This Version
------------------

Bugs referenced in the following text are bug numbers on
bugzilla.mozilla.org.

*** IMPORTANT CHANGES ***

- There is now a facility for new email tech users to choose
  the sort of notifications they wish to receive.  This
  facility will probably be improved in future versions.
  (bug 17464)

- "Changed" will no longer appear on the subject line of
  change notification emails.  Because of this, you should
  change the subject line in your 'changedmail' and
  'newchangedmail' params on editparams.cgi. The subject
  line needs to be changed from

    Subject: [Bug %bugid%] %neworchanged% - %summary%

  to

    Subject: [Bug %bugid%] %neworchanged%%summary%

  or whatever is appropriate for the subject you are using
  on your system. Note the removal of the " - " in the
  middle.
  (bug 29820)

- Some security holes have been fixed where shell escape characters
  could be passed to Bugzilla, allowing remote users to execute
  system commands on the web server.

*** Other changes of note ***

- Bug titles now appear in the page title, and will hence
  display in the user's browser's bookmarks and history.
  (bug 22041)
- Edit groups functionality (editgroups.cgi).
  (bug 25010)
- Support for moving bugs to other Bugzilla databases.
  (bug 36133)
- Bugzilla now can generate a frequently reported bugs list
  based on what duplicates you receive.
  (bug 25693)
- When installing Bugzilla fresh, the administrator account is
  now created in checksetup.pl.
  (bug 17773)
- Stored queries now show their name above the bug list, which
  helps the user when they have multiple bug lists in multiple
  browser windows.  It also appears in the page title, and will
  hence display in the user's browser's bookmarks and history.
  (bug 52228)
- All states and resolutions can now be collected for charting.
  (bug 6682)
- A new search-engine-like "quick search" feature appears on
  the front page to try and making searching easier.
  (bug 69793)
- Querying on dependencies now works in the advanced query
  section of the query page.
  (bug 30823)
- When a bug is marked as a duplicate, the reporter of the
  resolved bug is automatically added to the CC list of the
  open bug.
  (bug 28676)

*** Bug fixes of note ***

- Notification emails using new email tech will now be sent to
  QA contacts.
  (bug 30826)
- When marking a bug as a duplicate, the duplicate stamp marked
  on the open bug will no longer be written too early (such as
  on mid-air collisions).
  (bug 7873)
- Various bug fixes were made to the initial assignee and QA
  of a component.  It is no longer possible to enter an
  invalid address.  They will also now properly update when
  a user's email address is changed.  Sanity check will now
  check these.
  (bug 66876)
- Administrators can no longer create an email accounts that do
  not match the global email regexp parameter.  Previously this
  would cause sanity check errors.
  (bug 32971)
- The resolution field can no longer become empty when the
  bug is resolved.  This occurred because of midair collisions.
  (bug 49306)

*** Outstanding issues of note ***

- Bug counts (on reports.cgi) can be very slow if you have to
  count a lot of bugs.  In this case the connection can time
  out before the  page finishes loading.  Extending the cgi
  timeout on your web server might help this situation.
  (bug 63249)
- Administrators must make sure that certain files are
  properly inaccessible or confidential information might become
  available to enterprising individuals.  This includes the
  localconfig file, the entire shadow directory and the entire
  data directory except for data/comments (the quips file).
  (bug 65572)
- Renaming or removing keywords will not update the "keyword
  cache", and queries on keywords may not work properly, until
  you rebuild the cache on the sanity check page
  (sanitycheck.cgi).  The changer will receive a warning to do
  this when altering the keyword.
  (bug 69621)
- Email notifications will not work out of the box if you are
  using Postfix, Exim or possibly other non-SendMail mail
  transfer agents, as Bugzilla sends mail by default in
  "deferred" mode using the "-ODeliveryMode=deferred" command
  line option, which needs to be supported by the sendmail
  program.  To fix this, you can turn on the "sendmailnow"
  parameter on the Edit Parameters page (editparams.cgi).
  (bug 50159)
