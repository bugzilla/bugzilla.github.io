<h1>2.14.5 Release Notes</h1>
<pre>
The 2.14.5 release fixes some security issues in 2.14.4.  Please see the
upgrade procedure below for details on how to upgrade to 2.14.5.

*** PLEASE NOTE ***: The Bugzilla team no longer supports the 2.14 branch.
This is the last point release of 2.14, there will not be any more.   From
this point onwards if any additional security holes are discovered, you
will need to upgrade to a newer branch (i.e. 2.16.2 or later) or you will 
be on your own in patching your installation. 

Regarding security issues, please note that the 2.16 line (2.16.2 was 
released simultaneous with 2.14.5) incorporates various rearchitectures 
that make failure-to-validate and failure-to-filter errors harder to 
insert and easier to spot.  In particular this means there may be holes 
in the 2.14 line that have not been discovered, yet are fixed in the 
2.16 line.

**************************
*** ABOUT THIS VERSION ***
**************************

Bug numbers referenced in this document are all on
bugzilla.mozilla.org unless otherwise specified.

*** Recommended Practice For The Upgrade ***

As always, please ensure you have run checksetup.pl after
replacing the files in your installation.

It is recommended that you view the sanity check page
(sanitycheck.cgi) both before the upgrade and after running
checksetup.pl after the upgrade, to see if there are any
problems with your installation.

It is also recommended that if you can, you immediately fix
any problems you find.  Be aware that if the sanity check page
contains more errors after an upgrade, it doesn't necessarily
mean there are more errors in your database, as additional
tests are added to the sanity check over time, and it is likely
those errors weren't being checked for in the old version.

Failure to do this may mean that bugzilla will not
work correctly.

Administrators must make sure that certain files are
inaccessible or confidential information might become
available to enterprising individuals.  This includes the
localconfig file and the entire data directory.  Please
see the Bugzilla Guide for more information.

*** Deprecated Features ***

- The 2.16 line is the last stable release that will work with
  MySQL version 3.22.  Bugzilla in CVS requires at least 
  version 3.23.6.  (bug 87958)

- The 2.16 line is the last stable release to support the
  "shadow" database.  The replacement (using MySQL's built-in
  replication) is not present in 2.14.5 or 2.16.2, but we
  expect that very few sites use this feature, so we are not
  planning a transition period.  If this would cause a problem
  for you, please comment on the below bug.  (bug 124589)

- Placing comments in localconfig is deprecated.  If you have
  done this, they will likely get nuked with some post-2.16
  version of Bugzilla, as checksetup.pl will likely
  automatically rewrite localconfig to automatically get the
  latest instructional comments.  (bug 147776)

*** Outstanding Issues Of Note ***

These issues may have been fixed in later stable or development
versions of Bugzilla.  If you are interested in tracking these
bugs, please see the bug report numbers listed to find out the
status of the fix for these bugs, or to obtain a patch that can
fix the problem on your installation.

- Bug counts (on reports.cgi) can be very slow if you have to
  count a lot of bugs.  In this case the connection can time
  out before the page finishes loading.  Extending the cgi
  timeout on your web server might help this situation.
  (bug 63249)

- Renaming or removing keywords that are in use will not update
  the "keyword cache" on bugs, and queries on keywords may not work
  properly, until you rebuild the cache on the sanity check page
  (sanitycheck.cgi).  The changer will receive a warning to do
  this when altering the keyword.
  (bug 69621)

- Email notifications will not work out of the box if you are
  using Postfix, Exim or possibly other non-SendMail mail
  transfer agents, as Bugzilla sends mail by default in
  "deferred" mode using the "-ODeliveryMode=deferred" command
  line option, which needs to be supported by the sendmail
  program.  To fix this, you can turn on the "sendmailnow"
  parameter on the Edit Parameters page (editparams.cgi).
  (bug 37765)

- The new options to let people see a bug when their name
  is on it but who aren't in the groups the bug is restricted
  to only allow people to view bugs if they know the bug number.
  It still will not show up in these people's buglists and
  they will not receive email about changes to the bugs.
  (bugs 95024, 97469)

- Users behind rotating transparent proxies or otherwise having
  an IP that changes each URL fetch will find they need to log in
  regularly.
  (bug 20122)

- If you search on any CC or added comments, as well as at least
  one other of CC, added comments, assignee, reporter, etc, then
  the search can be very slow.  This is because of limitations of
  the MySQL optimiser.
  (bug 96101)

- Querying on CC takes too long on big databases.
  (bug 127200)

- The email preferences option "Priority, status, severity, and/or milestone
  changes" does not actually report status changes.  You can however use the
  option "The bug is resolved or verified" to achieve part of this.
  (bug 130821)

***********************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM 2.14.4 OR EARLIER  ***
***********************************************

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- Fixed a cross site scriptability issue in quips.  This is only a problem
  if quips with HTML could have been inserted into your quips files.  Bugzilla
  has not allowed this since 2.12.
  (bug 179329)
- checksetup.pl will now attempt to prevent access to "editor backups" of
  localconfig.
  (bug 186383)
- collectstats.pl no longer makes data/mining (which contains graphing
  information) world writeable.
  (bug 183188)

***********************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM 2.14.3 OR EARLIER  ***
***********************************************

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- When a new product is added to an installation with 47 groups or more and
  "usebuggroups" is enabled, the new group will be assigned a groupset bit
  using Perl math that is not exact beyond 2^48.  This results in the new
  group being defined with a "bit" that has several bits set.  As users are
  given access to the new group, those users will also gain access to
  spurious lower group privileges.  Also, group bits were not always reused
  when groups were deleted.
  (bug 167485)

- The email interface had another insecure single parameter system call.  This
  could potentially allow arbitrary shell commands to be run.  This file is
  not supported at this time, but as long as we knew about the problem, we
  couldn't overlook it.
  (bug 163024)

*** Bug fixes of note ***

- The email interface was broken.  This was a 2.14.3 regression.  This file
  is not supported at this time, but as long as we knew about the problem, we
  couldn't overlook it.
  (bug 160631)

***********************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM 2.14.2 OR EARLIER  ***
***********************************************

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- Basic maintenance on contrib/bug_email.pl and
  contrib/bugzilla_email_append.pl which also fixes a
  possible security hole with a misuse of a system() call.
  These files are not supported at this time, but as long
  as we knew about the problem, we couldn't overlook it.
  (bug 154008)

*** Bug fixes of note ***

- The fix for bug 130821 in 2.14.2 broke being able to sort
  bug lists on more than one field.  buglist.cgi now allows
  you to sort on more than one field again.
  (bug 152138)

***********************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM 2.14.1 OR EARLIER  ***
***********************************************

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- queryhelp.cgi no longer shows confidential products to
  people it shouldn't.
  (bug 126801)

- It was possible for a user to bypass the IP check by
  setting up a fake reverse DNS, if the Bugzilla web server
  was configured to do reverse DNS lookups.  Apache is not
  configured as such by default.  This is not a complete
  exploit, as the user's login cookie would also need to
  be divulged for this to be a problem.
  (bug 129466)

- In some situations the data directory became world writeable.
  (bug 134575)

- Any user with access to editusers.cgi could delete a user
  regardless of whether 'allowuserdeletion' is on.
  (bug 141557)

- Real names were not HTML filtered, causing possible cross
  site scripting attacks.
  (bug 146447, 147486)

- Mass change would set the groupset of every bug to be the
  groupset of the first bug.
  (bug 107718)

- Some browsers (eg NetPositive) interacted with Bugzilla
  badly and could have various form problems, including
  removing group restrictions on bugs.
  (bug 148674)

- It was possible for random confidential information to be
  divulged, if the shadow database was in use and became
  corrupted.
  (bug 92263)

- The bug list sort order is now stricter about the SQL it will accept,
  ensuring you use correct column name syntax.  Before this, there were
  some syntax checks, so it is not known whether this problem was
  exploitable.
  (bug 130821)

********************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM 2.14 OR EARLIER ***
********************************************

The 2.14.1 release fixes several security issues that became
known to us after the Bugzilla 2.14 release.

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- If LDAP Authentication was being used, Bugzilla would allow
  you to log in as anyone if you left the password blank.
  (bug 54901)

- It was possible to add comments or file a bug as someone else
  by editing the HTML on the appropriate submission page before
  submitting the form.  User identity is checked now, and the
  form values suggesting the user are now ignored.
  (bug 108385, 108516)

- The Product popup menu on the show_bug form listed all
  products, even if the user didn't have access to all of them.
  It now only shows products the user has access to (and the
  product the bug is in, if the user is viewing it because of
  some other override).
  (bug 102141)

- If a user had any blessgroupset privileges (the ability to
  change only specific privileges for other users), it was
  possible to change your own groupset (privileges) by
  altering the page HTML before submitting on editusers.cgi.
  (bug 108821)

- An untrusted variable was echoed back to user in the HTML
  output if there was a login error while editing votes.
  (bug 98146)

- buglist.cgi had an undocumented parameter that allowed you
  to pass arbitrary SQL for the "WHERE" part of a query.
  This has been disabled.
  (bug 108812)

- It was possible for a user to send arbitrary SQL by inserting
  single quotes in the "mybugslink" field in the user
  preferences.
  (bug 108822)

- buglist.cgi was not validating that the field names being
  passed from the "boolean chart" query form were valid field
  names, thus allowing arbitrary SQL to be inserted if you 
  edited the HTML by hand before submitting the form.
  (bug 109679)

- long_list.cgi was not validating that the bug ID parameter
  was actually a number, allowing arbitrary SQL to be inserted
  if you edited the HTML by hand.
  (bug 109690)

********************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM 2.12 OR EARLIER ***
********************************************

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- Multiple instances of unauthorised access to confidential
  bugs has been fixed.
  (bug 39524, 39526, 39527, 39531, 39533, 70189, 82781)

- Multiple instances of untrusted parameters not being
  checked/escaped was fixed.  These included definite security
  holes.
  (bug 38854, 38855, 38859, 39536, 87701, 95235)

- After logging in passwords no longer appear in the URL.
  (bug 15980)

- Procedures to prevent unauthorised access to confidential
  files are now simpler.  In particular the shadow directory
  no longer exists and the data/comments file no longer needs
  to be directly accessible, so the entire data directory can
  be blocked.  However, no changes are required here if you
  have a properly secured 2.12 installation as no new files
  must be protected.
  (bug 71552, 73191)

- If they do not already exist, checksetup.pl will attempt to
  write Apache .htaccess files by default, to prevent
  unauthorised access to confidential files.  You can turn this
  off in the localconfig file.
  (bug 76154)

- Sanity check can now only be run by people in the 'editbugs'
  group.  Although it would be better to have a separate
  group, this is not possible until the limitation on the
  number of groups allowed has been removed.
  (bug 54556)

- The password is no longer stored in plaintext form.  It will
  be eradicated next time you run checksetup.pl.  A user must
  now change their password via a password change request that
  gets validated at their e-mail account, rather than have it
  mailed to them.
  (bug 74032)

- When you are using product groups and you move a bug between
  products (single or mass change), the bug will no longer be
  restricted to the old product's group (if it was) and will
  be restricted to the new product's group.
  (bug 66235)

- There are now options on a bug to choose whether the
  reporter, and CCs can access a bug even if they aren't in
  groups the bug it is restricted to.
  (bug 39816)

- You can no longer mark a bug as a duplicate of a bug you
  can't see, and if you mark a bug a duplicate of a bug
  the reporter cannot see you will be given options as to
  what to do regarding adding the reporter of the resolved
  bug to the CC of the open bug.
  (bug 96085)

*** IMPORTANT CHANGES ***

- Bugzilla 2.14 no longer supports old email tech.  Upon
  upgrading, all users will be moved over to new email tech.
  This should speed up upgrading for installations with
  a large number of bugs.
  (bug 71552)

- There is new functionality for people to see why they are
  receiving notification mails.

  Previously, some people filtered old email tech
  notifications depending on whether they were in the To or the
  CC header, in order to get a limited way of determining why
  they were receiving the notification for filtering purposes.

  Existing installations will need to make changes to support
  this feature.  The receive reasons can be added to the
  notifications as a header and/or in the body.  To add these
  you will need to modify your newchangedmail parameter on
  editparams.cgi, either by resetting it or appropriately
  modifying it.  The header value is specified by
  %reasonsheader% and the body by %reasonsbody%.  For example,
  the new default parameter is:

  --------------------------------------------------
  From: bugzilla-daemon
  To: %to%
  Subject: [Bug %bugid%] %neworchanged%%summary%
  X-Bugzilla-Reason: %reasonsheader%

  %urlbase%show_bug.cgi?id=%bugid%

  %diffs%



  %reasonsbody%
  --------------------------------------------------

  (bug 26194)

- Very long fields (especially multi-valued fields like keywords,
  CCs, dependencies) on bug activity and notifications previously
  could get truncated, resulting in useless notifications and data
  loss on bug activity.  Now the multi-valued fields only show
  changes, and very big changes are split into multiple lines.
  Where data loss has already occurred on bug activity, it is
  indicated using question marks.
  (bug 55161, 92266)

- Previously, when a product's voting preferences changed all
  votes were removed from all the bugs in the product.  Also,
  when a bug was moved to another product, all of its votes
  were removed.  This no longer occurs.

  Instead, if the action would leave one or more bugs with
  greater than the maximum number of votes per person per bug,
  the number of votes will be reduced to the maximum.  The
  person will still be notified of this as before.

  If the action would leave a user with more votes in a product
  than is allowed, the limit will be breached so as to not lose
  votes.  However the user will not be able to update their
  votes except to fix this situation.  No further action is taken
  in this version to make sure that the user does this.
  (bug 28882, 92593)

*** Other changes of note ***

- Groups can now be marked inactive, so you can't add a new
  restriction on that group to a bug, while leaving bugs that
  were previously restricted on that group alone.
  (bug 75482)
- backdoor.cgi has been removed from the installation.  It was
  old code that was Netscape-specific and its name was scaring
  people.
  (bug 87983)
- You can now add or remove from CC on the bulk change page.
  (bug 12819)
- New users created by administrators are now automatically
  inserted into groups according to the group's regular
  expression.  Administrators must edit the user in a second
  step to override these choices.  Previously the
  administrator specified these explicitly which could lead
  to incorrect settings.
  (bug 45164)
- The userregexp of system groups can now be edited without
  resorting to direct database access.
  (bug 65290)

*** Bug fixes of note ***

- The bug list page was sometimes bringing up a not logged in
  footer when the user was logged in and the installation was
  using a shadow database.
  (bug 47914)
- You can now view the bug summary in your browser title for
  a group-restricted bug if you have proper permissions.
  (bug 71767)
- Quick search for search terms did not work in IE5.
  This has been worked around.
  (bug 77699)
- Quick search for search terms crashed NN4.76/4.77 for Unix.
  This has been worked around.
  (bug 83619)
- Queries on bugs you have commented on using the "added
  comment" feature should be a lot faster and not time out
  on large installations due to the addition of an index.
  (bug 57350)
- You can now alter group settings on bulk change for groups
  that aren't on for all bugs or off for all bugs.
  (bug 84714)
- New bug notifications now include the CC and QA fields.
  (bug 28458)
- Bugzilla is now more Windows friendly, although it is still
  not an official platform.
  (bug 88179, 29064)
- Passwords are now encrypted using Perl's encrypt function.
  This makes Bugzilla more portable to more operating systems.
  (bug 77473)
- Bugzilla didn't properly shut down when told to - some
  queries could still be sent to the database.
  (bug 95082)

********************************************
*** USERS UPGRADING FROM 2.10 OR EARLIER ***
********************************************

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- Some security holes have been fixed where shell escape characters
  could be passed to Bugzilla, allowing remote users to execute
  system commands on the web server.

*** IMPORTANT CHANGES ***

- There is now a facility for users to choose the sort of
  notifications they wish to receive.  This facility will
  probably be improved in future versions.
  (bug 17464)

- "Changed" will no longer appear on the subject line of
  change notification emails.  Because of this, you should
  change the subject line in your 'changedmail' and
  'newchangedmail' params on editparams.cgi.  The subject
  line needs to be changed from

    Subject: [Bug %bugid%] %neworchanged% - %summary%

  to:

    Subject: [Bug %bugid%] %neworchanged%%summary%

  or whatever is appropriate for the subject you are using
  on your system.  Note the removal of the " - " in the
  middle.
  (bug 29820)

*** Other changes of note ***

- Bug titles now appear in the page title, and will hence
  display in the user's browser's bookmarks and history.
  (bug 22041)
- Edit groups functionality (editgroups.cgi).
  (bug 25010)
- Support for moving bugs to other Bugzilla databases.
  (bug 36133)
- Bugzilla now can generate a frequently reported bugs list
  based on what duplicates you receive.
  (bug 25693)
- When installing Bugzilla fresh, the administrator account is
  now created in checksetup.pl.
  (bug 17773)
- Stored queries now show their name above the bug list, which
  helps the user when they have multiple bug lists in multiple
  browser windows.  It also appears in the page title, and will
  hence display in the user's browser's bookmarks and history.
  (bug 52228)
- All states and resolutions can now be collected for charting.
  (bug 6682)
- A new search-engine-like "quick search" feature appears on
  the front page to try and making searching easier.
  (bug 69793)
- Querying on dependencies now works in the advanced query
  section of the query page.
  (bug 30823)
- When a bug is marked as a duplicate, the reporter of the
  resolved bug is automatically added to the CC list of the
  open bug.
  (bug 28676)

*** Bug fixes of note ***

- Notification emails will now always be sent to QA contacts.
  Previously they wouldn't if you were using new email tech.
  (bug 30826)
- When marking a bug as a duplicate, the duplicate stamp marked
  on the open bug will no longer be written too early (such as
  on mid-air collisions).
  (bug 7873)
- Various bug fixes were made to the initial assignee and QA
  of a component.  It is no longer possible to enter an
  invalid address.  They will also now properly update when
  a user's email address is changed.  Sanity check will now
  check these.
  (bug 66876)
- Administrators can no longer create an email accounts that do
  not match the global email regular expression parameter.
  Previously this could occur and would cause sanity check
  errors.
  (bug 32971)
- The resolution field can no longer become empty when the
  bug is resolved.  This occurred because of midair collisions.
  (bug 49306)
