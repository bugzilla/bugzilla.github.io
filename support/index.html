<h1>Support</h1>

<h2>Bugzilla Support Options</h2>
<p>The options described here are for installation, administration, and
customization support for Bugzilla server software.  If you are an end-user of
a Bugzilla, please consult the support options made available by that
Bugzilla's owner.</p>

<h2>Where to Ask Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/forums/#support-bugzilla">mozilla.support.bugzilla</a></b> -
This discussion forum is for Bugzilla users and administrators of Bugzilla
sites to ask for help or share information. It is available as a mailing list,
newsgroup and Google Group.
</li>

<li>
  <b><a href="ircs://chat.freenode.net/bugzilla">#bugzilla</a></b> on freenode
  - Most of the Bugzilla developers are on this IRC channel. (although you may
  have to be patient to get our attention, since we aren't always watching the
  window).
</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="private-emails">Private Emails Do Not Help Others</h2>
<p>If you mail one of the Bugzilla developers
directly with a support question, you're likely to be ignored.  This doesn't
mean that we don't want to help you out, on the contrary, we very much want to
see you succeed in using Bugzilla.  It's just that we don't like answering the
same questions over and over again, and one-on-one support is pretty difficult
via email.  Thus we provide our general support in a public forum (the newsgroup
and mailing lists mentioned above) where the questions and answers get archived
and can be used by future Bugzilla admins at their leisure.  This also allows
other knowledgable Bugzilla admins help us out in providing support.  We'll
also try to help out on the IRC channel (see above) when possible (it's just
easier that way).</p>

<h2>Commercial Support</h2>
<p>Bugzilla is a community supported project.  This means we don't directly offer
any commercial support, but rather provide the public forums listed above where you can
get assistance.  If you're still looking for commercial support for Bugzilla, however,
you might try one of these
<a href="consulting.html">consultants</a> who have offered their services.</p>
