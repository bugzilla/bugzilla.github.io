<h1>Support</h1>

<h2>Bugzilla Support Options</h2>
<p>The options described here are for installation, administration, and
customization support for Bugzilla server software.  If you are an end-user of
a Bugzilla, please consult the support options made available by that
Bugzilla's owner.  Support for other Mozilla products (such as Firefox or
Thunderbird), can be found at
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/support/">https://www.mozilla.org/support/</a>.
</p>

<h2>Where to Ask Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="news://news.mozilla.org/mozilla.support.bugzilla">mozilla.support.bugzilla</a></b> -
This newsgroup is for
Bugzilla users and administrators of Bugzilla sites to ask for help or share
information.  This newsgroup is also gatewayed to a mailing list,
<b><a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/support-bugzilla">support<!-- blah -->-bugzilla<!-- blah -->@<!-- blah -->lists.mozilla.org</a></b>,
which you can subscribe to or browse the archives by visiting the <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/support-bugzilla">list information page</a>.  This mailing list was previously known as "mozilla-webtools" and was renamed on January 10th, 2006.  Archives of the previous 8 years of messages prior to that date can be found in <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/netscape.public.mozilla.webtools">Google Groups</a>.

<li>
  <b><a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/bugzilla">#bugzilla</a></b> 
  on <b>irc.mozilla.org</b> - Most of the Bugzilla developers are on this
  IRC channel. (although you may have to be patient to get our attention,
  since we aren't always watching the window).

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The easiest way to get onto IRC is to use the
    <a href="https://landfill.bugzilla.org/irc/">Bugzilla IRC Gateway</a>,
    which will let you chat with us without installing anything on your
    computer.</p>

  <p>We'll be happy to help you out if you need some quick one-on-one 
    assistance with something related to Bugzilla. (You may have to be patient
    to get our attention, since we aren't always watching the window). This is
    also a good place to hang out if you just want to see the up-to-the-minute
    happenings while we're reviewing and coding.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="private-emails">Private Emails Do Not Help Others</h2>
<p>If you mail one of the Bugzilla developers
directly with a support question, you're likely to be ignored.  This doesn't
mean that we don't want to help you out, on the contrary, we very much want to
see you succeed in using Bugzilla.  It's just that we don't like answering the
same questions over and over again, and one-on-one support is pretty difficult
via email.  Thus we provide our general support in a public forum (the newsgroup
and mailing lists mentioned above) where the questions and answers get archived 
and can be used by future Bugzilla admins at their leisure.  This also allows 
other knowledgable Bugzilla admins help us out in providing support.  We'll
also try to help out on the IRC channel (see above) when possible (it's just
easier that way).</p>

<h2>Commercial Support</h2>
<p>Bugzilla is a community supported project.  This means we don't directly offer
any commercial support, but rather provide the public forums listed above where you can
get assistance.  If you're still looking for commercial support for Bugzilla, however,
you might try one of these
<a href="consulting.html">consultants</a> who have offered their services.</p>
