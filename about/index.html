<h1>About Bugzilla</h1>

<h2>What is Bugzilla?</h2>

<p> Bugzilla is a robust, featureful and mature defect-tracking system, or
bug-tracking system. Defect-tracking systems allow teams of developers to
keep track of outstanding bugs, problems, issues, enhancement and other change
requests in their products effectively. Simple defect-tracking capabilities
are often built into integrated source code management environments such as
Github or other web-based or locally-installed equivalents. We find
organizations turning to Bugzilla when they outgrow the capabilities of
those systems - for example, because they want workflow management, or
bug visibility control (security), or custom fields.</p>

<p>Bugzilla is both free as in freedom and free as in price. Most commercial
defect-tracking software vendors charge enormous licensing fees.  Despite
being free, Bugzilla has <a href="../features/">many features</a> which are
lacking in both its expensive and its free counterparts. Consequently,
Bugzilla is used by
<a href="../installation-list/">hundreds or thousands of organizations</a>
across the globe.</p>

<p>Bugzilla is a web-based system but needs to be installed on your server
for you to use it. However, installation is not complex.</p>

<h2>A Brief History of Bugzilla</h2>

<p>When mozilla.org first came online in 1998, one of the first products that
was released was Bugzilla, a bug system implemented using freely available open
source tools.  Bugzilla was originally written in
<a href="http://www.tcl.tk/scripting/">TCL</a> by Terry Weissman for use at
mozilla.org to replace the in-house system then in use at Netscape.  The
initial installation of Bugzilla was deployed to the public on a mozilla.org
server on
<a href="https://www-archive.mozilla.org/news.html#p17" target="_blank">April 6, 1998</a>.</p>
<p>After a few months of testing and fixing on a public deployment,
Bugzilla was finally released as open source via anonymous CVS and available
for others to use on
<a href="https://www-archive.mozilla.org/news.html#p44" target="_blank">August 26, 1998</a>.
At this point. Terry decided to port Bugzilla to
<a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a>, with the hopes that more people would be
able to contribute to it, since Perl seemed to be a more popular language.
The completion of the port to Perl was announced on
<a href="https://www-archive.mozilla.org/news.html#p51" target="_blank">September 15, 1998</a>,
and committed to CVS 
<a href="https://github.com/bugzilla/bugzilla/commit/4727e6c09f88e63f02e6c8f359862d0c0942ed36" target="_blank">later that night</a>.</p>
<p>After a few days of bake time, this was released as Bugzilla 2.0 on
September 19, 1998.  Since then a large number of projects, both commercial and free
have adapted it as their primary method of tracking software defects.  In April
of 2000, Terry handed off control of the Bugzilla project to Tara Hernandez.
Under Tara's leadership, some of the regular contributors were coerced into
taking more responsibility, and Bugzilla began to truly become a group effort.
In July of 2001, facing lots of distraction from her "real job," Tara handed
off control to Dave Miller, who is still in charge as of this writing.</p>

<a href="/releases/">releases</a> page.</p>
