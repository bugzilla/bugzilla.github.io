There are lots of ways to contribute to the Bugzilla project:

*   **Code**: You can [contribute to the Bugzilla codebase](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Developers) if you are familiar with Perl or features Bugzilla has/wants, such as DB, WebServices, etc. See also: [Developer's Guide](/contributing/developer)
*   **Web Development and User Interface Design**: [contribute to the Bugzilla UI](/contributing/developer) if you are a designer and/or are good at HTML and/or CSS.
*   **Documentation**: You can [contribute to the Bugzilla Documentation](http://bugzilla.readthedocs.org/en/latest/style.html) if you are familiar with Bugzilla as an administrator or as a user, or good at English.
*   **Release Process**: You can [help with the release process](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Release_Process) if you have some time to give us.
*   **QA**: You can [help with the QA process](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:QA) if you are familiar with Bugzilla as an administrator or as a user, and have some time.
*   **Support**: Bugzilla is community-supported. If you're an old hand at using or administering Bugzilla, hang out in our [support venues](/support/) such as our support mailing list or IRC channel and help other users.

## Mailing List

**[developers@bugzilla.org](https://lists.bugzilla.org/listinfo/developers)**
- This mailing list is for discussion among people who are assisting
with the development of Bugzilla. Discussion on this list tends to get
quite technical. If you're interested in contributing code to Bugzilla,
you should subscribe to this list. [Browse Archives](https://lists.bugzilla.org/pipermail/developers)

## IRC

Much Bugzilla development discussion happens in real time on IRC. We
hang out on the [\#bugzilla](ircs://irc.libera.chat/#bugzilla) channel
on libera.chat. Feel free to drop in there anytime to discuss Bugzilla
(both development and support discussion happens there).

The easiest way to get on IRC is to use the [Kiwi web IRC
client](https://web.libera.chat/#/#bugzilla), which
lets you chat with us through your browser, without installing anything.
