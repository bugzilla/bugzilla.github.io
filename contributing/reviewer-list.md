This is a list of who to ask for review. You may ask any reviewer to
review any change to any file, but they may defer it to another reviewer
if they do not feel qualified.

The following is a list of *all* people currently authorized to
approve/deny review on patches.

All changes to this list must be approved by [Dave
Miller](mailto:justdave@bugzilla.org).

## Become a Reviewer\!

Think you'd make a good reviewer? With the rapidly-growing Bugzilla
community, we're increasingly needing good reviewers. We generally
require that you've submitted some patches of your own so that we can
tell you know what you're doing. If you are interested, contact [Dave
Miller](mailto:justdave@bugzilla.org), Bugzilla Project Manager, and let
him know you'd like to help out. If Dave agrees that you're ready to
become a reviewer, you will be added to this page. You may be asked to
spend some more time developing and submitting patches, so we can get to
know you better first.
