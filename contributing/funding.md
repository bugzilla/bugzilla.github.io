<h2>What Bugzilla Spends Money On</h2>

<p>All monetary amounts listed on this page are in US Dollars (USD).</p>
<p>Amounts last updated 2023/11/17.</p>

<h3>One Time Expenses</h3>

<p>Zarro Boogs Corporation was just recently formed by a group of the core
Bugzilla Developers in order to have a legal entity which could hold the
license to the Bugzilla trademark and potentially pay one or more developers.
We incured the following costs in setting up this entity:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>$1500.00</strong> - Legal fees related to researching the proper
structure for the new company, creating the founding documents to make the
company legit, and registering it with the State of Michigan</li>
<li><strong>$50.00</strong> - Filing fee to apply for §501(c)(4) status from
the US Internal Revenue Service</li>
<li><strong>$1700.00</strong> - Legal fees to cover lawyer time during
negotiations with the Mozilla Foundation to obtain the license to use the
Bugzilla trademark</li>
<li><strong>$400.00</strong> - year-to-date hosting costs for two servers in
Linode (January to March at $45 (x3 = $135), April to August at $53 (x5 =
$265)) paid before we had a way to collect donations.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Payoff Progress</h4>

<p>Funded by one-time donations.</p>
<div class="fundprogress">
<span class="fundprogressbar_current">$2425</span>
<progress class="fundprogressbar" max="3650" value="2425"></progress>
<span class="fundprogressbar_total">$3650</span>
</div>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/bugzilla" class="button primary">Contribute</a> towards this goal at GitHub Sponsors (GitHub account required).
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://donate.stripe.com/eVadTl5xa53RcIEeUV" class="button primary">Contribute</a> towards this goal via Stripe (credit, debit, Apple Pay, CashApp). Stripe will deduct 2.9% + 30¢ from your contribution as a transaction fee.
</p>
<p>If you give via Stripe and want to cover the fee (completely optional), here's the formula: Take the amount you want us to get, add 30¢, then divide by 0.971.  For example, if you want us to get $100, add 30¢ to make 100.30, then divide by 0.971 and round it to two places after the decimal, which gives you $103.30. To verify it, subtract 2.9% to get 100.3043, round to two digits after the decimal to get 100.30, then subtract 30¢ to get $100.</p>

<h3>Ongoing Necessary Expenses</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>$53.00 per month</strong> - Server Hosting: 2 servers in Linode.</li>
<li><strong>$20.00 per year</strong> - State of Michigan Non-profit filing fee. (÷12 = $1.67 per month)</li>
</ul>

<p>Funded by recurring donations.</p>

<div class="fundprogress">
<span class="fundprogressbar_current">$55</span>
<progress class="fundprogressbar" max="55" value="55"></progress>
<span class="fundprogressbar_total">$55</span>
</div>

<p><b>This goal has been met! Thank you!</b></p>
<p>Additional recurring donations are still needed for the Permanent developer
fund (scroll down).</p>

<h3>Ongoing "Nice to have" expenses</h3>

<h4>General project fund</h4>

<p>Any money received beyond the goals listed above will go into a pool to be
used towards hiring a developer to work on code or review submitted patches for
one-off projects. Once enough money collects to be worth funding a project,
we'll have someone work on it. Recurring donations that exceed the monthly
necessities goal will be contributed to the one-time expenses pay-off fund
first before being placed here, until those expenses are paid off.</p>

<p>Current accumulated unspent balance of one-time and recurring donations
exceeding the above goals:</p>
<div class="fundprogress"><span class="fundprogressbar_current">$0</span></div>

<h4>Permanent developer</h4>

<p>Our pie-in-the-sky goal right now is to have a permanent part-time developer
to work around 20 hours per per week on Bugzilla on whatever needs doing, and
not just one-off projects. To do this, we anticipate needing about $4000 per
month in recurring donations. <b>Until the one-time expenses goal is met, 
the balance of this fund at the end of each month will be contributed to that 
fund.</b> After that, it will be contributed to the general project fund each 
month. Once the permenant developer goal is hit, then a developer will be 
hired, instead.</p>

<p>Single-month recurring donations exceeding the above necessary expenses:</p>

<div class="fundprogress">
<span class="fundprogressbar_current">$172</span>
<progress class="fundprogressbar" max="4000" value="172"></progress>
<span class="fundprogressbar_total">$4000</span>

<h2>Why Bugzilla Needs Money Now</h2>

<p>Historically, most of Bugzilla's development was done by coders who worked
at companies who used Bugzilla, where those companies allowed them to spend
time working on the public version of Bugzilla since it got their features
included in future Bugzilla versions without them having to locally customize
it.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is no longer the case. In the name of immediate productivity,
companies get the quickest results by customizing their local copy only for
their own use, and not taking the time to contribute those changes to the
public version. Being able to upgrade it down the line without losing their
customizations is "someone else's problem in the future." (Incidentally, we'd
love your help if you're a company that uses Bugzilla and can let one of your
internal developers spend a couple hours per week on Bugzilla!)</p>

<p>Because Bugzilla is now in this position, we are trying to raise enough
money to directly pay at least one developer, so that it will actually be
someone's job to work on Bugzilla, at least part time. That is our
pie-in-the-sky goal.</p>

<h2>The Legal Stuff</h2>

<p>In mid-2023, a group of the core developers formed <a
href="/about/zarroboogs.html">Zarro Boogs Corporation</a> (ZBC) in order to be
a legal entity which could hold the license to the Bugzilla Trademark and raise
money on behalf of the project. ZBC is a non-charitable non-profit organization
(US Tax Code §501(c)(4) status pending IRS approval), and registered as a
Non-Profit Corporation in the State of Michigan, which means we are required to
spend all money raised on the needs of the project, and not make a profit on
it. However, since we are not a charity, your donations will not be tax
deductible. The Bugzilla trademarks are used under license from the Mozilla
Foundation. ZBC is not affiliated with the Mozilla Foundation.</p>
