you need to go to **<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/>**.

## There are other Bugzillas...

Many people seem to find this page when trying to report bugs in a
variety of products. This page is **\*only\*** for reporting bugs that
affect the Bugzilla bug tracking software itself. Lots and lots of
companies and organizations use Bugzilla to handle their bug reporting,
but in almost all cases, it's not **\*this\*** Bugzilla. If someone told
you to report a bug in Bugzilla, but the bug you came to report isn't
about Bugzilla itself, you might try looking for the correct Bugzilla on
our [installation list](/about/installation-list/) or look on the affected
product's web site to see if they link to their Bugzilla (or other bug
tracking system) directly.

## Reporting bugs that affect Bugzilla:

  - **If you are not the administrator of a Bugzilla** then you are
    probably looking for the above paragraph (titled "There are other
    Bugzillas"). These links are only for problems that affect the
    Bugzilla bug tracking system itself, they are not for problems in
    other products. The Bugzilla bug tracking system is a product of its
    own, and it's that Bugzilla product which is referenced here.
  - [Look to see if your bug has already been
    reported](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/query.cgi?resolution=---&resolution=DUPLICATE&product=Bugzilla).
  - If a related bug doesn't already exist, [report a new
    bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Bugzilla).
  - Write full and complete bug reports so we can fix your problem as
    soon as possible.
