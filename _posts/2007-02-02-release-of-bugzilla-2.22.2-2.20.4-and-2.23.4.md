[Bugzilla 2.22.2](/releases/2.22.2/) is a bug-fix and security release:

*   [Download Bugzilla 2.22.2](/download/#v222)
*   Read the Bugzilla 2.22.2 [Release Notes](/releases/2.22.2/)

We also released [Bugzilla 2.20.4](/releases/2.20.4/), a security-fix release for the 2.20 series.

Finally, you can use [Bugzilla 2.23.4](/releases/2.24/) in your testing environments. 2.23.4 is fairly stable, since it's currently running on [bugzilla.mozilla.org](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/), but it still hasn't gone through QA yet, so it may have unfound critical issues.

There is a [Security Advisory](/security/2.20.3/) for all three releases. Please read it, particularly if you were using 2.23.3.
