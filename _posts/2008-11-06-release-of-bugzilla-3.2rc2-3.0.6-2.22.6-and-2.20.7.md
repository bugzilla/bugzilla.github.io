Today there are four releases of Bugzilla!

The biggest release is [Bugzilla 3.2rc2](/releases/3.2/). There have been a lot of changes since 3.2rc1, particularly in the UI, so we wanted to put out another release candidate to get feedback. If all goes well with this release candidate, it should become 3.2 final in a few weeks with very few changes. 3.2rc2 is stable enough to use in small production environments, but major installations should wait for 3.2 final before upgrading.

*   Read the [Release Notes](/releases/3.2/)
*   See a list of [New Features](/releases/3.2) in 3.2

We fixed a security bug in all releases that are coming out today, so there is also a [Security Advisory](/security/2.20.6/) to read.

Other than 3.2rc2, there are three other releases: [3.0.6](/releases/3.0.6/), [2.22.6](/releases/2.22.6/), and [2.20.7](/releases/2.20.7/). 3.0.6 has some minor bug fixes, 2.22.6 brings Perl 5.10 compatibility to the 2.22 series, and 2.20.7 is just a security release.
