We are proud to announce the release of Bugzilla 2.20, a major new feature release for Bugzilla. Bugzilla 2.20 includes a large number of major new features, and hundreds of small enhancements and bug fixes over Bugzilla 2.18.

*   [Download Bugzilla 2.20](/download/#220)
*   See the [new features in 2.20](/releases/2.20/).
*   Read the [Release Notes](/releases/2.20/) for Bugzilla 2.20\. (This is **particularly important** if you are upgrading from an older version.)
*   See [a list of changes](https://github.com/bugzilla/bugzilla/compare/2.20) between your version of Bugzilla and the current version.

We also have two other releases, a security fix for the 2.18 series, (Bugzilla 2.18.4),and our latest development snapshot (Bugzilla 2.21.1).

For details on all the releases, see our new, very detailed [Status Update](/blog/2005/09/30/status-update).

All of these releases fix security flaws discovered in older versions of Bugzilla. For details, read the [Security Advisory](/security/2.18.3/).

There is no release on the Bugzilla 2.16 branch, because it was not affected by any of the security issues. 2.16 users should note that support for 2.16 will be totally discontinued with the release of Bugzilla 2.22, and so they are encouraged to ugprade to Bugzilla 2.20 as soon as possible.
