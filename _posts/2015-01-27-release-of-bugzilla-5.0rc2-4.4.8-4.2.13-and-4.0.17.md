Today we have several new releases for you!

[Bugzilla 5.0rc2](/releases/5.0/) is our second Release Candidate for Bugzilla 5.0\. This release has receive QA testing, and should be considerably more stable than the development releases before it. It is still not considered fully stable, and so you should understand that if you use it, you use it at your own risk.

If feedback from this release candidate indicates that it is mostly stable, then Bugzilla 5.0 will be released in a few weeks. If feedback indicates that more extensive fixes are needed, there may be another release candidate after this one.

### Upcoming EOL for 4.0.x

Please note that once Bugzilla 5.0 is released, this will mark the End Of Life for the Bugzilla 4.0 series. This will mean that there will be no further updates for the 4.0.x series, even if there are serious security issues found in that series. We recommend that all installations running the 4.0 series upgrade as soon as possible to the current stable 4.4 version or 5.0 when released.

Bugzilla 5.0 will also be our first stable release to be only available using Git. This means you will not be able to use bzr (Bazaar) anymore to upgrade to or install 5.0\. The 4.0 branch is the last branch available on CVS, so any documentation referencing the use of CVS for installation or upgrading will no longer be valid.
