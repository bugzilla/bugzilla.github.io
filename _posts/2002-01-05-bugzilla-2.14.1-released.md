Bugzilla 2.14.1 is now available for download. For details of upgrade
options and download locations see the [downloads page](/download/).

If you already have a version of Bugzilla 2.15 that was checked out of
CVS, please DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS VERSION, but use `cvs update` to pull
in these fixes. Bugzilla 2.14.1 does not contain most of the code
currently in CVS, but is only patches that have been back-ported to the
2.14 code base in order to seal security holes that were too important
to wait until we finish 2.16\. If you have version 2.15 from CVS and
have have updated later than January 3, 2002, you already have all of
these security fixes.

View the [release notes](/releases/2.14.1/) and the
**[security advisory](/security/2.14.1/)**.

For changes between 2.14 and 2.14.1, view the
[Bugzilla changelog](https://github.com/bugzilla/bugzilla/compare/2.14).
