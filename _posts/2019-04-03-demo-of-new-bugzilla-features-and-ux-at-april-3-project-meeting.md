Our regular monthly project meeting video conference call for April will
be Wednesday, April 3 at 8pm UTC / 4pm EDT / 1pm PDT.Â  We're getting
close (relatively) with Bugzilla 6 - currently estimating end of summer
or early fall, and we'll be having some live demos of some of the recent
new features and user experience improvements in Bugzilla at this
month's meeting, so you won't want to miss it.
