We are proud to announce the first [Release Candidate of Bugzilla 2.20](/releases/2.20/), a major new feature release for Bugzilla. Bugzilla 2.20 includes support for PostgreSQL, a new "Large Attachment" storage mechanism, a new level of bug classification, user-defined periodic reminders by email, and [many other new features](/releases/2.20/).

Bugzilla 2.20rc1 is recommended to be used for testing purposes only. The final release will be shaped by your feedback over the next few weeks.

We are also releasing a bug-fix release for the 2.18 series, [2.18.2](/releases/2.18.2/). The 2.18 series is recommended for users in production environments. All users of the 2.18 series are recommended to upgrade to 2.18.2 as soon as possible.

*   [Download](/download/#stable) Bugzilla 2.18.2
*   Read the [Release Notes](/releases/2.18.2/) for 2.18.2

There is also a [Security Advisory](/security/2.18.1/) for Bugzilla 2.18.1 and 2.19.3.

We would like to remind users of the 2.16 series that we expect to stop maintenance on 2.16 around October 2005, so they should plan to upgrade to 2.18 or 2.20 before then.
