The Bugzilla Team is please to announce the release of our third release candidate for Bugzilla 2.18\. This release will be shaped by your feedback over the next few weeks.

Also released are stable version 2.16.7 and development snapshot version 2.19.1\. All three releases fix a few security issues.

*   [Security Advisory](/security/2.16.6/)
*   [2.18 Release information](/releases/2.18/)
*   [2.16.7 Release notes](/releases/2.16.7/)
*   [Download page](/download/)  

We are doing a 3rd release candidate because there was a major change to the group security mechanisms in the Charting code. We would appreciate any testing, particularly related to the new "Charts over time" code using groups to limit access to charts.

We have also posted a new [status update](/blog/2004/10/24/status-update) to help keep everyone informed of where the project is heading.
