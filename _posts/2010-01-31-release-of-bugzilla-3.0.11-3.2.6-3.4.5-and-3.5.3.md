Today we have four new releases:

[Bugzilla 3.4.5](/releases/3.4.5/) is our latest stable release. It contains various useful bug fixes and security improvements:

*   [Download 3.4.5](/download/#v34)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.4.5/) for 3.4.5

[Bugzilla 3.2.6](/releases/3.2.6/) is a security update for the 3.2 branch:

*   [Download 3.2.6](/download/#v32)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.2.6/) for 3.2.6

[Bugzilla 3.0.11](/releases/3.0.11/) is a security update for the 3.0 branch:

*   [Download 3.0.11](/download/#v30)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.0.11/) for 3.0.11

[Bugzilla 3.5.3](/releases/3.6/) is our latest unstable development release. We are now feature-frozen for 3.6, so though there will be a few functional changes between now and the final release, this is mostly what 3.6 will look like when it comes out. As usual with development releases, this release has not received QA testing from the Bugzilla Project, and should not be used in production environments. Development releases exist as previews of the features thatthe next major release of Bugzilla will contain. They also exist for testing purposes, to collect bug reports and feedback, so if you find a bug in this development release (or you don't like how some feature works) please [tell us](/contributing/reporting_bugs).

For details on what's new in this development release and what's going on with the Bugzilla Project, see the latest [Bugzilla Update](/blog/2010/02/01/release-3.4.5).

*   [Download 3.5.3](/download/#v36)

All of today's releases contain security fixes. We recommend that all Bugzilla administrators read the [Security Advisory](/security/3.0.10/) that was published along with these releases.
