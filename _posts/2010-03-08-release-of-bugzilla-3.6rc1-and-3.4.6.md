[Bugzilla 3.6rc1](/releases/3.6/) is our first Release Candidate for Bugzilla 3.6\. This release has received QA testing, and should be considerably more stable than the development releases before it. It is still not considered fully stable, and so you should understand that if you use it, you use it at your own risk.

If feedback from this release candidate indicates that it is mostly stable, then Bugzilla 3.6 will be released in a few weeks. If feedback indicates that more extensive fixes are needed, there may be another release candidate after this one.

Since this is a Release Candidate, it includes Release Notes and a listing of New Features. Make sure to check out the "Other Enhancements and Changes" section in particular--there are a lot of great improvements listed in there!
