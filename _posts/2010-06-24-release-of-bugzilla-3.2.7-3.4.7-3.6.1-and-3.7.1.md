Today we have four new releases! One new development snapshot (3.7.1), two new stable releases (3.6.1 and 3.4.7) and one update for the legacy 3.2 branch, 3.2.7.

All of today's releases contain security fixes. We recommend that all Bugzilla administrators read the [Security Advisory](/security/3.2.6/) that was published along with these releases.

[Bugzilla 3.6.1](/releases/3.6.1/) is our latest stable release. It contains various useful bug fixes and security improvements:

*   [Download 3.6.1](/download/#v36)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.6.1/) for 3.6.1

[Bugzilla 3.4.7](/releases/3.4.7/) is a security and bug-fix update for the 3.4 branch. This is the last bug-fix release for the 3.4 series--after this, it will only get new updates if there are security issues discovered in the 3.4 series.

*   [Download 3.4.7](/download/#v34)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.4.7/) for 3.4.7

[Bugzilla 3.2.7](/releases/3.2.7/) is a security update for the 3.2 branch:

*   [Download 3.2.7](/download/#v32)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.2.7/) for 3.2.7

[Bugzilla 3.7.1](/releases/4.0/) is an unstable development release, with a ton of exciting new features and UI improvements. However, this release has received **no** testing from the Bugzilla Project, so it should not be used in production environments. Development releases exist as previews of the features that the next major release of Bugzilla will contain. They also exist for testing purposes, to collect bug reports and feedback, so if you find a bug in this development release (or you don't like how some feature works) please [tell us](/contributing/reporting_bugs).

For details on what's new in this development release and what's going on with the Bugzilla Project, see our latest [Bugzilla Update](/blog/2010/06/24/release-3.6.1/).
