In an effort to provide better communication about just what's going on,
and to make Bugzilla more accessible, we've redesigned the Bugzilla
project pages to try to make the information more useful and help people
find things.

One of the major new features of the site is the [Status Updates](/blog/)
section, which contains a (pretty lengthly) discussion of everything
that's gone into Bugzilla so far since version 2.14 was released. This
will be a regularly updated column with a new update every week or two
(so they won't all be as lengthly as the first one).

Like our new logo in the header above? I don't, but I'm a crappy artist,
and we have yet to have anything else submitted. If you have an idea for
our logo, please visit [bug 100095](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100095).
