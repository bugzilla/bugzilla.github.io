In 1998, the first open-source version of Bugzilla, 2.0, was released to the world without much fanfare, just [this little post](https://groups.google.com/group/netscape.public.mozilla.announce/browse_thread/thread/b52aa841db9f7e9b/f10c0f781841f10d#f10c0f781841f10d) on the `netscape.public.mozilla.announce` newsgroup.

Nine years later, Bugzilla is used by thousands of companies around the world with millions of total users. It has become the de-facto standard in open-source bug tracking. Thousands of companies have moved away from their costly commercial bug-tracking systems to Bugzilla, usually finding Bugzilla more flexible and more full-featured than the system they'd been paying thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars for, and proving that open source software really can produce a competitive product.

Today, the Bugzilla Project is extremely proud to announce the release of [Bugzilla 3.0](/releases/3.0), and just like Terry said in 1998, "We like the new version much better, and hope you will too."

Here's just a sampling of the major new features in version 3.0:

*   Custom Fields
*   mod_perl support for greatly-improved performance
*   Per-Product Permissions
*   XML-RPC Interface
*   Create and Modify Bugs by Email
*   and [much, much more...](/releases/3.0)

Bugzilla 3.0 also has a much-improved code base over previous versions of Bugzilla. Improvements are still happening, but long-time customizers and coders of Bugzilla will notice significant improvements. And if you haven't seen Bugzilla code since 2.16 or so, prepare to be (pleasantly) surprised!

As always, we welcome open source [contributors](/contribute/) to Bugzilla, which is made entirely by volunteers around the world. You too can be part of the team that makes a product used by thousands of people daily.
