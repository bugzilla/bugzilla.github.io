We've now missed more than one target trying to complete Bugzilla 2.16\.
Based on our current progress, we've backed our target release date off
to February 1st. We're deeply sorry to keep everyone waiting, but we'd
rather have it done right than rushed, and several of us have been short
on time lately. If you can assist with any coding for the remaining
blockers, feel free to submit patches to the bugs in question. See the
[Master Plan](/about/#milestones) page for a link to those
bugs.
