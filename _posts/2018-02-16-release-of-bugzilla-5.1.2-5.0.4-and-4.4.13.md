Today we have several new releases.

All of today's releases contain security fixes. We recommend that all Bugzilla administrators read the [Security Advisory](/security/4.4.12/) that was published along with these releases.

[Bugzilla 5.0.4](/releases/5.0.4/) is our latest stable release. It contains various useful bug fixes and security improvements:

*   [Download 5.0.4](/download/#v50)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/5.0.4/) for 5.0.4

[Bugzilla 4.4.13](/releases/4.4.13/) is a security update for the 4.4 branch:

*   [Download 4.4.13](/download/#v44)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/4.4.13/) for 4.4.13

[Bugzilla 5.1.2](/releases/6.0/) is an unstable development release. This release has not received QA testing from the Bugzilla Project, and should not be used in production environments. Development releases exist as previews of the features that the next major release of Bugzilla will contain. They also exist for testing purposes, to collect bug reports and feedback, so if you find a bug in this development release (or you don't like how some feature works) please [tell us](/contributing/reporting_bugs).

*   [Download 5.1.2](/download/#v60)
