Almost a year after Bugzilla 4.0, the Bugzilla team is proud to announce the first release candidate for Bugzilla 4.2. This release contains major improvements to search, support for SQLite, improved WebServices, and lots of other enhancements. Also, all of today's releases contain security fixes. We recommend that all Bugzilla administrators read the [Security Advisory](/security/3.4.12/) that was published along with these releases.

[Bugzilla 4.2rc1](/releases/4.2/) is our first Release Candidate for Bugzilla 4.2\. This release has received QA testing, and should be considerably more stable than the development releases before it. It is still not considered fully stable, and so you should understand that if you use it, you use it at your own risk.

If feedback from this release candidate indicates that it is mostly stable, then Bugzilla 4.2 will be released in a few weeks. If feedback indicates that more extensive fixes are needed, there may be another release candidate after this one.

*   [Release Notes](/releases/4.2/) for 4.2rc1

[Bugzilla 4.0.3](/releases/4.0.3/) is our latest stable release. It contains various useful bug fixes and security improvements:

*   [Download 4.0.3](/download/#v40)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/4.0.3/) for 4.0.3

[Bugzilla 3.6.7](/releases/3.6.7/) is a security update for the 3.6 branch:

*   [Download 3.6.7](/download/#v36)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.6.7/) for 3.6.7

[Bugzilla 3.4.13](/releases/3.4.13/) is a security update for the 3.4 branch:

*   [Download 3.4.13](/download/#v34)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.4.13/) for 3.4.13

Note that once we release the final Bugzilla 4.2, the 3.4.x series will reach **End Of Life**. This means that it won't get any new security fixes, leaving these installations vulnerable to these exploits. Installations still running 3.4.x or older are strongly encouraged to upgrade to 4.0.x or 4.2rc1.
