Yesterday, we had our monthly project meeting, and did it
panel-discussion style from the Mozilla AllHands meeting in Orlando,
FL.  We ended up with quite an interesting discussion with lots of good
info about Bugzilla 6, and some questions for users of Bugzilla (feel
free to comment here with your answers\!).  The recorded video is here:
