1.  Updates from Dylan
    1.  CyberShadow is a big help getting Harmony in shape to be run by
        itself
    2.  If you're making a large change, make lots of small pull
        requests if possible (they can be on the same bug) as it makes
        it easier to review. That's been working very well with
        CyberShadow's changes.
    3.  Bugzilla (Harmony) now working with Mojolicious which is a big
        deal (mostly for OAuth2 compatibility)
    4.  "Rake me over the coals if there's no 5.0.{next} release by the
        next meeting"
2.  Updates from Dave
    1.  Still waiting on hosting info for our bots and email from
        Mozilla, hopefully soon
    2.  History section on the website has been moved to the About page.
        It's been updated with the help of Asa Dotzler correcting some
        inaccuracies and expanding it based on old Mozilla press
        releases and commit records. <https://www.bugzilla.org/about/>
3.  Next meeting is on Wednesday, May 2, at 9pm BST (UTC+1), 4pm EDT
    (UTC-4), 1pm PDT (UTC-7)
