This month's Bugzilla Project meeting coincides with the Mozilla
Allhands in Orlando, and since most of our usual participants will be
here in person we'll be holding it panel-discussion style from the
Europe 2 conference room on the Lobby level of the Dolphin at 4pm
Eastern. Anyone who's at the Allhands is welcome to come see us. Of
course, it'll still be streamed on Air Mozilla at 21:00 UTC as usual,
and dial-in will be available for anyone remote who wants to talk or ask
questions.Â  All the details (Sched link, Video stream links, dial-in
info) is at <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Meetings>
