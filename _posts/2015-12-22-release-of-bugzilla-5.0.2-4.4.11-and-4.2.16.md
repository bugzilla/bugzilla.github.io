Today we have several new releases for you!

All of today's releases contain two security fixes. We recommend that all Bugzilla administrators read the [Security Advisory](/security/4.2.15/) that was published along with these releases.

### EOL for 4.2.x

With this release, Bugzilla 4.2 is now end-of-lifed. This means no fixes of any kind will be issued for Bugzilla 4.2 from today onwards. All Bugzilla admins are encouraged to [upgrade](https://bugzilla.readthedocs.org/en/5.0/installing/upgrading.html) to the latest version of Bugzilla, especially those running 4.2 or earlier.
