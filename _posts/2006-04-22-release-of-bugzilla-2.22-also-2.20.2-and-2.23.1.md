The Bugzilla Project is proud to announce the official release of Bugzilla 2.22\. Bugzilla 2.22 is a major new feature release for Bugzilla, containing a large number of bug fixes and enhancements, including complete PostgreSQL support, UTF-8 support, user-impersonation capabilities, and more.

*   [Download Bugzilla 2.22](/download/#v222)
*   See a list of the [New Features](/releases/2.22) in Bugzilla 2.22.
*   Read the [Release Notes](/releases/2.22/) for Bugzilla 2.22 (**especially important** if you are upgrading).
*   Read the latest [Status Update](/blog/2006/04/22/status-update) to see where the Bugzilla Project is heading and what's been going on in the last few months!

We are also releasing [Bugzilla 2.20.2](/releases/2.20.2/), a bug-fix release for the 2.20 branch, recommended for all 2.20 branch users.

We also have a development snapshot, [Bugzilla 2.23.1](/releases/2.24/), the branch which will someday be released as 2.24 or 3.0\. This snapshot is **not tested**, and should only be installed in a test environment. It's entirely possible that it contains a bug which will delete your entire bug database. Or, it could be perfectly safe. Since it hasn't been tested, nobody knows for sure. You Have Been Warned.
