[Bugzilla 3.3.1](/releases/3.4/) is our first development snapshot of what will eventually become Bugzilla 3.4\. Right now this snapshot should be consisdered very unstable--it has received no testing whatsoever. It is just here to give you an idea of what the new features in Bugzilla 3.4 will be like.

This is a fairly important period for feedback, since we will have a feature freeze for Bugzilla 3.4 on January 29--fairly soon. If you think a feature in 3.3.1 should work some other way, now is the time to let us know!
