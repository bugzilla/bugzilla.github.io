Due to a small "brown bag" issue in 2.14.2, 2.14.3 has been released. This release contains two extra fixes to 2.14.2 - we fixed column sorting in buglists, and made a system call in the optional, unsupported, contributed email subsystem more secure.

The 2.14.x branch is Bugzilla's older stable branch. New installations and upgraders are strongly recommended to use 2.16.
