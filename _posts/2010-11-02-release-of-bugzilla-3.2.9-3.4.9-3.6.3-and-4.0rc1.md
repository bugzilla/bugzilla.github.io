Today is the release of our first Release Candidate for 4.0, in addition to the bug-fix release for our stable branch, 3.6.3, and two security-only releases for older branches, 3.4.9 and 3.2.9. All of today's releases contain important security fixes, and we recommend that all Bugzilla administrators read the [Security Advisory](/security/3.2.8/) that was published along with these releases.

[Bugzilla 4.0rc1](/releases/4.0/) is our first Release Candidate for Bugzilla 4.0\. This release has received QA testing, and should be considerably more stable than the development releases before it. It is still not considered fully stable, and so you should understand that if you use it, you use it at your own risk. In particular, certain aspects of the WebServices have not yet been tested as part of this Release Candidate, so they may change before the final release.

If feedback from this release candidate indicates that it is mostly stable, then Bugzilla 4.0 will be released in a few weeks. If feedback indicates that more extensive fixes are needed, there may be another release candidate after this one.

*   [Release Notes](/releases/4.0/) for 4.0rc1

[Bugzilla 3.6.3](/releases/3.6.3/) is our latest stable release. It contains various useful bug fixes and security improvements:

*   [Download 3.6.3](/download/#v36)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.6.3/) for 3.6.3

[Bugzilla 3.4.9](/releases/3.4.9/) is a security update for the 3.4 branch:

*   [Download 3.4.9](/download/#v34)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.4.9/) for 3.4.9

[Bugzilla 3.2.9](/releases/3.2.9/) is a security update for the 3.2 branch:

*   [Download 3.2.9](/download/#v32)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.2.9/) for 3.2.9

Note that once we release the final Bugzilla 4.0, the 3.2.x series will reach **End Of Life**. This means that no new updates will be released for 3.2.x, even if there are serious security issues found in that series. All installations running 3.2.x are strongly encouraged to update to 3.6.x or 4.0rc1.
