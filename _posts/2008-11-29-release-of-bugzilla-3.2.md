Today we are releasing the first major release of Bugzilla after 3.0, [Bugzilla 3.2](/releases/3.2/). Bugzilla 3.2 has an enormous number of [new features](/releases/3.2), including some great user interface enhancements, custom statuses, new custom field types, Oracle support, and lots of other improvements.

You can also see our [latest Status Update](/blog/2008/11/29/status-update) to find out what's going on in the Bugzilla Project, our plans for Bugzilla 4.0, and all that.

The release of Bugzilla 3.2 means that the Bugzilla 2.20 series has now reached End-Of-Life. This means that no development will be done on the 2.20 series anymore, and no new 2.20 releases will be made, even if there are security holes in the 2.20 series.
