We had a small "oops" with the 2.17.5 release, whereas one of the new features that was introduced also introduced a new security hole. For the full details, read the [security advisory](/security/2.17.5/). Note that this affects **version 2.17.5 only** and the current stable **version 2.16.4 is not affected**. Since this is the development branch, there have been other checkins besides the security fix. For a complete list, click the "2.17.5 â†’ 2.17.6" link on the [changelog page](https://github.com/bugzilla/bugzilla/compare/2.18). Version 2.17.6 is available on the [download page](/download/#devel).
