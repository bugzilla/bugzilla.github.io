[Christian Reis](http://www.async.com.br/~kiko/) and [Eric S. Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/) have released an initial version of [bugzilla-submit](/download/#utils), a command-line utility to post new bugs to a Bugzilla installation. We'd like to invite testing and feedback on the tool and its functionality; note that it requires Python 2.3\. Post bug reports as usual to [bugzilla.mozilla.org](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/).
