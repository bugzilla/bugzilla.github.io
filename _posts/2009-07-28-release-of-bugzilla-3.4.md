[Bugzilla 3.4](/releases/3.4/) is a new major release from the Bugzilla Project! It contains a LOT of great new features, including:

*   A greatly-simplified bug-filing page.
*   A new front page for Bugzilla.
*   Users' email addresses are now hidden from logged-out users (helps prevent users receiving spam)
*   Emails can be sent in the background (which greatly speeds up editing bugs)
*   URLs of searches are now much shorter, so they can be more easily shared.
*   Exciting new custom field enhancements
*   A field that allows you to refer to bugs in other Bugzillas.

And lots of other exciting new features! You can see the [complete list](/releases/3.4/#v34_feat) in the [Release Notes](/releases/3.4/).

*   [Download 3.4](/download/#v34)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.4/) for 3.4
*   [New Features](/releases/3.4/#v34_feat) in Bugzilla 3.4

The Bugzilla Project would like to thank all of the organizations and individuals that contributed to Bugzilla 3.4! Without you, there wouldn't be any Bugzilla at all!

### EOL For Bugzilla 2.22

The release of Bugzilla 3.4 marks the End Of Life for the Bugzilla 2.22.x series. This means that there will be no further updates released for Bugzilla 2.22.x, even if there are security holes found in that release. If you are running Bugzilla 2.22.x, we recommend that you upgrade to 3.4 immediately.

Instructions for upgrading Bugzilla are in the [Upgrading section of the Bugzilla Guide](/docs/3.4/en/html/upgrade.html). You should also read the [Notes for Upgraders](/releases/3.4/#v34_upgrading) in the Release Notes for Bugzilla 3.4, 3.2, and 3.0.
