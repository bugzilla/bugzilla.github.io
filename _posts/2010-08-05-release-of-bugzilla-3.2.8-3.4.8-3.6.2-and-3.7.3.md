There are four new releases today. All of today's releases contain security fixes. We recommend that all Bugzilla administrators read the [Security Advisory](/security/3.2.7/) that was published along with these releases.

[Bugzilla 3.6.2](/releases/3.6.2/) is our latest stable release. It contains various useful bug fixes and security improvements:

*   [Download 3.6.2](/download/#v36)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.6.2/) for 3.6.2

[Bugzilla 3.4.8](/releases/3.4.8/) is a security update for the 3.4 branch:

*   [Download 3.4.8](/download/#v34)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.4.8/) for 3.4.8

[Bugzilla 3.2.8](/releases/3.2.8/) is a security update for the 3.2 branch:

*   [Download 3.2.8](/download/#v32)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.2.8/) for 3.2.8

[Bugzilla 3.7.3](/releases/4.0/) is our third unstable development release leading to Bugzilla 4.0\. We have done a fair amount of QA on this release. However, QA found [many bugs that have not yet been fixed](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=prod:Bugzilla+flag:blocking4.0%2B), so this release should not be used in production environments. Development releases exist as previews of the features that a future release of Bugzilla will contain. They also exist for testing purposes, to collect bug reports and feedback. So, if you find a bug in this development release (or you don't like how some feature works) please [tell us](/contributing/reporting_bugs).

*   [Download 3.7.3](/download/#v40)
