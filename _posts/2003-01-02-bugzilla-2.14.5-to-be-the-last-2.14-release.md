The Bugzilla Team has released Bugzilla 2.14.5 today to address two security issues which were recently discovered. As we've been warning for the last several months, we are no longer supporting the 2.14 branch as of the end of 2002, so this release marks the last for the 2.14 line. All sites who haven't already done so are strongly encouraged to upgrade to 2.16.2 so you can continue to receive security updates.
