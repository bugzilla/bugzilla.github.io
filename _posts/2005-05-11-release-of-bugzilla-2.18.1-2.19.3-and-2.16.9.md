Today we are releasing Bugzilla 2.18.1, a bug-fix release for the 2.18 series. It contains various useful bug and security fixes for the original 2.18 release.

We are also releasing a _very unstable_ development snapshot, 2.19.3, for those who want to track the bleeding edge of Bugzilla development. We expect our next development release after this to be Release Candidate 1 (2.20rc1).

Finally, there is a security-fix release for the old 2.16 series, version 2.16.9\. Users of 2.16 are still encouraged to upgrade to 2.18 as soon as it is possible.
