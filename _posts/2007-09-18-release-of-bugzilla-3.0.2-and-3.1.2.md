We have two new releases, primarily to fix an important security issue discovered in the 3.0.x and 3.1.x series.

### 3.0.2

[Bugzilla 3.0.2](/releases/3.0.2/) contains the security fix and a few other minor bug fixes.

*   [Download Bugzilla 3.0.2](/download/#v30).
*   Read the [Release Notes](/releases/3.0.2/) for 3.0.2.

### 3.1.2

[Bugzilla 3.1.2](/releases/3.2/) also contains the security fix, but just like 3.1.1, it has had massive changes and received little or no testing. It should be considered unstable and only used in testing environments.

*   [Download Bugzilla 3.1.2](/download/#v32)
