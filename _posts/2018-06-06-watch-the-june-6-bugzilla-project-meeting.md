  - Short meeting this week because Dylan is traveling and either in an
    airport or on a plane right now
  - Updates from Dave
      - As noted at previous meetings Mozilla is downsizing and trying
        to find external hosting for the Bugzilla Project which they'll
        still pay for, they just want to get out of the hosting
        bussiness.
      - Bugzilla needs to exist as a separate legal entity from the
        Mozilla Foundation for purposes of contracting with a hosting
        company, so our current status is waiting on the legal work to
        get done to create a Bugzilla subsidiary of Mozilla Foundation.
      - The top condender for hosting right now is Linode. Other
        possibilities are OSUOSL and Eclipse (Emmanual reminded us of
        their offer)
      - <https://landfill.bugzilla.org/> has been closed up - static
        page announcing that it's closing will be in place until the end
        of July. Contact Dave if you need something retrieved from it
        before July.
  - Development updates:
      - Dylan has Bugzilla mostly running in Mojolicious.
        <https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/bmo/pull/517>
  - Next meeting is scheduled for July 4th. Watch for announcements on
    social media channels closer to that date whether it'll happen then
    or not (it's a US holiday)
