We've added a Developers' Guide and a Reviewers' Guide to our
"[Developer Resources](/developers/)" page to assist those interested
in getting involved to get to know how we do things.

We also have a long awaited [status update](/blog/2002/03/03/status-update)
to explain why we still haven't released Bugzilla 2.16.
