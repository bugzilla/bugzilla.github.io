Today we have a new development snapshot for you, Bugzilla 2.23.2. It has a lot of improvements and changes since 2.23.1, so we wanted to get it out and get it tested!

However, remember that this is a development release, and so it has **not been thoroughly tested**. You should only use it in a testing environment!

*   [Download Bugzilla 2.23.2](/download/#v224)
*   Read the latest [Status Update](/blog/2006/07/09/status-update), which contains a description of what's new in this release.
