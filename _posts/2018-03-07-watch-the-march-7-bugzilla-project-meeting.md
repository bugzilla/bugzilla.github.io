      - watch the meeting video recording for commentary (it's good
        stuff\!)
  - Infrastructure updates
      - www.bugzilla.org was switched over to GitHub Pages finally -
        this gets it out of Mozilla's internal hosting infrastructure
        and into somewhere the Bugzilla project has some amount of
        control over.
          - typo fixes and other pull requests welcome at
            <https://github.com/bugzilla/bugzilla.github.io>
      - We have a couple leads on hosting for the remaining Bugzilla
        project infrastructure - will hopefully have movement on this in
        the next month or so. (we have until August to get out of
        Mozilla's old datacenter)
  - Any other business
      - none brought up.

The next meeting will be on Wednesday, April 4, at 20:00 UTC (9pm BST /
4pm EDT / 1pm PDT)
