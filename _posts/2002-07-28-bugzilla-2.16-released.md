The Bugzilla Team is relieved and pleased to finally announce the release of Bugzilla 2.16, and also a new [status update](/blog/2002/07/28/status-update). The product of 11 months of hard work, Bugzilla 2.16 is the first release of Bugzilla to have a templatised UI, allowing administrators easily to customise the look and feel of their Bugzilla without editing Perl code.

There are no security fixes in 2.16 that were not in 2.16rc2 - but anyone running a version of Bugzilla older than that needs to read the [2.16rc2 and 2.14.2 security advisory](/security/2.14.2/) and previous advisories. Bugzilla 2.16 is the best Bugzilla, and the Bugzilla team strongly recommends its use over all other versions.
