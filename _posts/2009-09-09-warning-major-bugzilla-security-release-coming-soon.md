A major security issue has been discovered in versions of Bugzilla back
to 3.0. We will be releasing a version of Bugzilla which fixes the issue
within 48 hours (possibly within 24 hours), and all administrators
should be ready to perform the upgrade (which does not require any
database changes) shortly after the new version is released.

If you do not wish to do a full upgrade, patches for just the security
issue will be available. The patches are relatively small and do not
modify very much of Bugzilla.
