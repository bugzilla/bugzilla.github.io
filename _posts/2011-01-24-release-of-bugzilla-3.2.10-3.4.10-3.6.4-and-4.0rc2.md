Some serious security issues were discovered in Bugzilla, and as a result we have four security releases for you today. We recommend that all Bugzilla administrators read the [Security Advisory](/security/3.2.9/) that was published along with these releases, and that you update as soon as possible.

[Bugzilla 4.0rc2](/releases/4.0/) is our second Release Candidate for Bugzilla 4.0\. This release has received QA testing, and should be considerably more stable than the development releases before it. It is still not considered fully stable, and so you should understand that if you use it, you use it at your own risk.

If feedback from this release candidate indicates that it is mostly stable, then Bugzilla 4.0 will be released in a few weeks. If feedback indicates that more extensive fixes are needed, there may be another release candidate after this one.

*   [Release Notes](/releases/4.0/) for 4.0rc2

[Bugzilla 3.6.4](/releases/3.6.4/) is our latest stable release. It contains various useful bug fixes in addition to the security patches. This is likely to be the last bug-fix release in the 3.6 series. Once Bugzilla 4.0 is released, the 3.6 series will only get security fixes.

*   [Download 3.6.4](/download/#v36)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.6.4/) for 3.6.4

[Bugzilla 3.4.10](/releases/3.4.10/) is a security update for the 3.4 branch:

*   [Download 3.4.10](/download/#v34)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.4.10/) for 3.4.10

[Bugzilla 3.2.10](/releases/3.2.10/) is a security update for the 3.2 branch. Please remember that with the release of Bugzilla 4.0, the Bugzilla 3.2 series will reach **End Of Life**. That means that this is very likely to be the last security release ever for the 3.2 series.

*   [Download 3.2.10](/download/#v32)
*   [Release Notes](/releases/3.2.10/) for 3.2.10
