We've released a [security advisory](/security/2.16.7-nr/) and [patches](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=272620) for a potential cross-site scripting issue with Bugzilla's error messages. Not all browsers are affected, but to protect all of your users, applying the patches is recommended. These fixes will be included in the upcoming 2.16.8 and 2.18 releases as well as the next snapshot from the trunk (either 2.20rc1 or 2.19.2).
