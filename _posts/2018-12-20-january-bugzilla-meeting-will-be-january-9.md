Our regular meeting schedule dictates that our meetings are held on the
first Wednesday of every month at 21:00 London Time.  Since the first
Wednesday of January is the 2nd and a lot of people will still be on
vacation then (and we'll have issues getting resources for the meeting)
we'll be holding our January meeting on January 9th instead.  You can
still find all the details at

The Upcoming events in the sidebar here will update to reflect that
whenever WordPress's cache expires.
