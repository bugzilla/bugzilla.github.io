[Christian Reis](http://www.async.com.br/~kiko/) has released a new version of [bugzilla-submit](https://www.bugzilla.org/download/#utils), a command-line utility to post new bugs to a Bugzilla installation. This version fixes issues with .netrc parsing of base URLs, Python version checking and processing of Operating-System and URL fields. It also include text and manpage versions of the documentation (which was only available as XML source in previous versions).

Note that bugzilla-submit requires Python 2.3\. Bug reports should go to [bugzilla.mozilla.org](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Bugzilla&component=Bugzilla+General).
