### 3.0.3

[Bugzilla 3.0.3](/releases/3.0.3/) is the last stable release of the 3.0.x series. In addition to various bug fixes, it contains important performance improvements for mod_perl installations.

*   [Download Bugzilla 3.0.3](/download/#v30).
*   Read the [Release Notes](/releases/3.0.3/) for 3.0.3.

There is no development release at this time, as the current CVS HEAD code is not stable enough even for a development release.
