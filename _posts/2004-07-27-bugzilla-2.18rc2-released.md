Our second release candidate for Bugzilla 2.18 is now available. There are a few major issues addressed that snuck into 2.18rc1, so if you're already running 2.18rc1, an upgrade is strongly recommended. Information about what's new and what's still left to fix is on the [2.18 Release Status page](/releases/2.18/).
