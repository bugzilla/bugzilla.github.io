Today the Bugzilla project has four releases!

### 3.0.1

[Bugzilla 3.0.1](/releases/3.0.1/) is the first bug-fix release for the 3.0 series. 3.0 was very stable, but 3.0.1 adds a lot of little polish fixes that greatly improve the experience of using Bugzilla.

*   [Download Bugzilla 3.0.1](/download/#v30).
*   Read the [Release Notes](/releases/3.0.1/) for 3.0.1.

### 3.1.1

[Bugzilla 3.1.1](/releases/3.2/) is our first development release toward Bugzilla 3.2\. It has a huge number of new features, but is **extremely unstable**. It has not been tested, and should not be used in a production environment. It may fail in critical ways, or destroy your data. However, it is useful as a feature preview and for testing purposes.

*   [Download Bugzilla 3.1.1](/download/#v32)
*   See our latest [Status Update](/blog/2007/08/23/status-update) for a report of what's going on with the Bugzilla Project and a list of new features in 3.1.1.

### 2.22.3 and 2.20.5

[Bugzilla 2.22.3](/releases/2.22.3/) and [Bugzilla 2.20.5](/releases/2.20.5/) are security-fix and critical bug-fix releases for the 2.22 and 2.20 series. If you are using any 2.22 or 2.20 version, we strongly recommend you update to these versions.

*   **Bugzilla 2.20.5**: [Download](/download/#v220) and read the [Release Notes](/releases/2.20.5/).
*   **Bugzilla 2.22.3**: [Download](/download/#v222) and read the [Release Notes](/releases/2.22.3/).

### Security Advisory
