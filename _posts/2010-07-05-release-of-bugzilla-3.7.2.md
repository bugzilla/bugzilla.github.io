Today we have a new development snapshot that fixes a [serious security issue](/security/3.7.1/) in the previous development snapshot.

[Bugzilla 3.7.2](/releases/4.0/) is the new development snapshot that fixes this issue. However, please do remember that this is an unstable development release. This release has not received QA testing from the Bugzilla Project, and should not be used in production environments. Development releases exist as previews of the features that the next major release of Bugzilla will contain. They also exist for testing purposes, to collect bug reports and feedback, so if you find a bug in this development release (or you don't like how some feature works) please [tell us](/contributing/reporting_bugs).
