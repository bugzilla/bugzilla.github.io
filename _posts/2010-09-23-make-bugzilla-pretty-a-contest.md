Hello out there, developers and designers\! After many years of working
on Bugzilla's usability, we have finally come to the point where we
think that it's time...we want to make Bugzilla **look nice**. Gone are
the days when it is OK for open-source software to be functional but
unattractive--Bugzilla needs a UI that not only works well, but also
looks great\!

To this end, we are having [a contest for
designers](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Pretty), to see who can come
up with the best new design for Bugzilla. It's called [Make Bugzilla
Pretty](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Pretty)\!

You don't have to know anything about HTML or Bugzilla to enter (though
it helps), you just have to be able to redesign and submit an image to
us.

With your entry, you could be giving the world a great-looking
open-source bug-tracking system, impacting the lives of millions of
developers, forwarding the cause of open-source in the new decade, and
getting some sweet promotion for yourself in the process\!

We look forward to seeing what you come up with\!
