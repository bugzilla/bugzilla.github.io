There have been two really big WebService enhancements checked in to the
Bugzilla 4.0 tree in the last few days:

  - [Bug.update](http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/tip/en/html/api/Bugzilla/WebService/Bug.html#update),
    which allows you to update all of a bug's fields via the WebService.
  - [Bug.add\_attachment](http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/tip/en/html/api/Bugzilla/WebService/Bug.html#add_attachment),
    which lets you add an attachment to a bug via the WebService.

These will be available in most Bugzilla installations once they upgrade
to 4.0. There are a lot of great possibilities for these, including
version-control integration, the ability to automatically attach
screenshots to a Bugzilla bug, etc. I wanted to let everybody know about
them in advance so that you can start building tools that will integrate
well with Bugzilla 4.0\!
