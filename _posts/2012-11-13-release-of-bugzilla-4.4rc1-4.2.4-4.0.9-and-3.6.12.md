Today we have several new releases for you!

All of today's releases contain security fixes. We recommend that all Bugzilla administrators read the [Security Advisory](/security/3.6.11/) that was published along with these releases.

[Bugzilla 4.4rc1](/releases/4.4/) is our first Release Candidate for Bugzilla 4.4\. This release has received QA testing, and should be considerably more stable than the development releases before it. It is still not considered fully stable, and so you should understand that if you use it, you use it at your own risk.

If feedback from this release candidate indicates that it is mostly stable, then Bugzilla 4.4 will be released in a few weeks. If feedback indicates that more extensive fixes are needed, there may be another release candidate after this one.
