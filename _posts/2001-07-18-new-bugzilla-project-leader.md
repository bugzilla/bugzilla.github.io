Reality has hit hard for [Tara Hernandez](mailto:tara@tequilarista.org),
as she was recently promoted to director of her area at
[Blue Martini Software](http://www.bluemartini.com/), and has suddenly
found herself with very little time to spare for the Bugzilla project.
Facing this reality, she was forced to step down as the project leader
for Bugzilla and handed off the reigns to
[Dave Miller](mailto:justdave@bugzilla.org). Tara is not leaving the
Bugzilla project, and will continue to contribute when she has time, as
well as administering the bugzilla test server at
[landfill.tequilarista.org](http://landfill.tequilarista.org/). An
[announcement](news://news.mozilla.org/3B562E3F.4080602@tequilarista.org)
was recently posted to
[netscape.public.mozilla.webtools](news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.webtools).
This is not expected to impact the v2.14 release, which is still slated
within the next few weeks.
