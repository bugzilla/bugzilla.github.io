title: "3.2.6, 3.4.6, 3.6.0, and 3.7 Security Advisory"
versions: ["3.2.7", "3.4.7", "3.6.1", "3.7.1"]
date: 2010-06-24
bugs:
- summary: |-
    Everybody could search for time-tracking information, not just
    members of the timetrackinggroup.
  class: Remote Information Disclosure
  affected: 2.17.1 to 3.2.6, 3.3.1 to 3.4.6, 3.5.1 to 3.6, 3.7
  fixed-in: 3.2.7, 3.4.7, 3.6.1, 3.7.1
  description: |-
    Normally, information about time-tracking (estimated
    hours, actual hours, hours worked, and deadlines) is
    restricted to users in the "time-tracking group".
    However, any user was able, by crafting their own
    search URL, to search for bugs based using those
    fields as criteria, thus possibly exposing sensitive
    time-tracking information by a user seeing that a bug
    matched their search.

  cve: CVE-2010-1204
  reported-by: Teemu Mannermaa
  fixed-by: Max Kanat-Alexander, Frédéric Buclin
- summary: |-
    Under suexec, "localconfig" was world-readable, meaning that
    local users with shell access to the Bugzilla server may have
    been able to see the database password and the site_wide_secret.
  class: Local Information Disclosure
  affected: 3.5.1 to 3.6, 3.7
  fixed-in: 3.6.1, 3.7.1
  description: |-
    If $use_suexec was set to "1" in the localconfig file,
    then the localconfig file's permissions were set as
    world-readable by checksetup.pl. This allowed any user
    with local shell access to see the contents of the file,
    including the database password and the site_wide_secret
    variable used for CSRF protection.
