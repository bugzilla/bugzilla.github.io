title: "2.20.4, 2.22.2, and 3.0 Security Advisory"
versions: ["2.20.5", "2.22.3", "3.0.1", "3.1.1"]
date: 2007-08-23
bugs:
- summary: |-
    A possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when filing bugs
    using the guided form.
  class: Cross-Site Scripting
  affected: 2.17.1 and above
  description: |-
    Bugzilla does not properly escape the 'buildid' field in
    the guided form when filing bugs. From 2.17.1 till 2.23.3,
    this field was based exclusively on the User-Agent string
    returned by your web browser. Since 2.23.4, this parameter
    can be defined in the URL passed to enter_bug.cgi, overwriting
    the User-Agent string and may lead to cross-site scripting.
    The guided form is not usually used by Bugzilla installations,
    as it is shipped only as an example to be modified for their
    own use.

- summary: |-
    When using email_in.pl, insufficiently escaped data may be passed to
    sendmail.
  class: Command Injection
  affected: 2.23.4 and above
  description: |-
    Bugzilla 2.23.4 and newer use the Email:: modules instead
    of the Mail:: and MIME:: ones. The argument passed to the -f
    option of Email::Send::Sendmail() is insufficiently escaped
    and may lead to limited command injection when called from
    email_in.pl, a script which was also introduced in 2.23.4.

- summary: |-
    Users using the WebService interface may access Bugzilla's time-tracking
    fields even if they normally cannot see them.
  class: Information Leak
  affected: 2.23.3 and above
  description: |-
    Bugzilla's WebService (XML-RPC) interface allows you to access
    the time-tracking fields (such as Deadline, Estimated Time, etc.)
    on all bugs, even if you normally cannot access time-tracking
    fields.
