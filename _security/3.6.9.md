title: "4.3.1, 4.2.1, 4.0.6, and 3.6.9 Security Advisory"
versions: ["3.6.10", "4.0.7", "4.2.2", "4.3.2"]
date: 2012-07-26
bugs:
- summary: |-
    In HTML bugmails, an improper validation of the permissions of the
    addressee can lead to confidential information about bugs and
    attachments to be visible to the addressee.
  class: Information Leak
  affected: 4.1.1 to 4.2.1, 4.3.1
  fixed-in: 4.2.2, 4.3.2
  description: |-
    In HTML bugmails, all bug IDs and attachment IDs are
    linkified, and hovering these links displays a tooltip
    with the bug summary or the attachment description if
    the user is allowed to see the bug or attachment.
    But when validating user permissions when generating the
    email, the permissions of the user who edited the bug were
    taken into account instead of the permissions of the
    addressee. This means that confidential information could
    be disclosed to the addressee if the other user has more
    privileges than the addressee.
    Plain text bugmails are not affected as bug and attachment
    IDs are not linkified.
