date: 2015-12-22
bugs:
- summary: |-
    Unfiltered HTML injected into a dependency graph could be used to
    create a cross-site scripting attack.
  class: Cross-Site Scripting
  affected: Bugzilla 2.6 to 4.2.15, 4.3.1 to 4.4.10, 4.5.1 to 5.0.1
  fixed-in: 4.2.16, 4.4.11, 5.0.2
  description: |-
    During the generation of a dependency graph, the code for
    the HTML image map is generated locally if a local dot
    installation is used. With escaped HTML characters in a bug
    summary, it is possible to inject unfiltered HTML code in
    the map file which the CreateImagemap function generates.
    This could be used for a cross-site scripting attack.

- summary: |-
    Some web browsers incorrectly parse CSV files as valid JavaScript
    code which could lead to data leak.
  class: Information Leak
  affected: Bugzilla 2.17.1 to 4.2.15, 4.3.1 to 4.4.10, 4.5.1 to 5.0.1
  fixed-in: 4.2.16, 4.4.11, 5.0.2
  description: |-
    If an external HTML page contains a &lt;script> element with
    its src attribute pointing to a buglist in CSV format, some
    web browsers incorrectly try to parse the CSV file as valid
    JavaScript code. As the buglist is generated based on the
    privileges of the user logged into Bugzilla, the external
    page could collect confidential data contained in the CSV
    file.
