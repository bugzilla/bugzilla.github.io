<h1>2.16.10 Security Advisory</h1>
December 27, 2005<br/>
<pre>
Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of 
software projects.

This advisory covers an insecure temporary filename handling issue in 
versions of Bugzilla prior to 2.16.11 which make use of the shadow 
database feature.  Versions 2.18 and newer are not affected, nor are 
older installations which do not use the shadow database.


Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Insecure temporary filename handling
Impact:      Privilege escalation
Where:       Local system
Versions:    2.9 through 2.16.10.  Newer versions are not
             affected.
Description: Bugzilla uses a script called syncshadowdb to manually
             replicate data between a master database and a slave.
             The script uses temporary files in an unsafe way since it
             selects a name for the file based on PID and does not make
             any effort to determine if the file exists and if it is a
             symlink. A local user could use this to direct symlink
             attacks and overwrite files that Bugzilla has access to.
Reference:   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=305353
CVE Name:    CVE-2005-4534


Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fix for this security issue will be included in the upcoming 2.16.11 
release of Bugzilla.  In the meantime, the patch to fix this issue can 
be obtained from the URL listed in the reference above.  The patch only 
touches the syncshadowdb file.

Please note that Bugzilla version 2.16.* is an older release and very 
near end-of-life of its security support.  Users are advised to upgrade 
to the latest stable release as soon as possible to continue to receive 
security support.
