title: "3.2.7, 3.4.7, 3.6.1, and 3.7.2 Security Advisory"
versions: ["3.2.8", "3.4.8", "3.6.2", "3.7.3"]
date: 2010-08-05
bugs:
- summary: |-
    It was possible to (at least partially) determine the membership
    of any group using the Search interface.
  class: Remote Information Disclosure
  affected: 2.19.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1, 3.7 to 3.7.2
  fixed-in: 3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3
  description: |-
    An unprivileged user is normally not allowed to view
    other users' group membership. But boolean charts
    let the user use group-based pronouns, indirectly
    disclosing group membership. This security fix
    restricts the use of pronouns to groups the user
    belongs to.

  cve: CVE-2010-2756

- summary: |-
    It was possible to use the 'sudo' feature without sending
    a notification to the user being impersonated.
  class: Notification Bypass
  affected: 2.22rc1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1, 3.7 to 3.7.2
  fixed-in: 3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3
  description: |-
    Normally, when a user is impersonated, he receives
    an email informing him that he is being impersonated,
    containing the identity of the impersonator. However,
    it was possible to impersonate a user without this
    notification being sent.

  cve: CVE-2010-2757
  reported-by: Bradley Baetz
  fixed-by: Frédéric Buclin, Byron Jones
- summary: |-
    The 'Reports' and 'Duplicates' pages let you guess the name of
    products you could not see, due to the error message that was
    thrown.
  class: Remote Information Disclosure
  affected: 2.17.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1, 3.7 to 3.7.2
  fixed-in: 3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3
  description: |-
    An error message thrown by the "Reports" and "Duplicates"
    page confirmed the non-existence of products, thus
    allowing users to guess confidential product names.
    (Note that the "Duplicates" page was not vulnerable
    in Bugzilla 3.6rc1 and above though.)

  cve: CVE-2010-2758
  reported-by: Frédéric Buclin
  fixed-by: Max Kanat-Alexander, Frédéric Buclin
- summary: |-
    For installations using PostgreSQL, specifying "bug X" or
    "attachment X" in a comment would deny access to the bug if X was
    larger than the maximum 32-bit signed integer size.
  class: Denial of Service
  affected: 2.23.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1, 3.7 to 3.7.2
  fixed-in: 3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3
  description: |-
    If a comment contained the phrases "bug X" or
    "attachment X", where X was an integer larger than the
    maximum 32-bit signed integer size, PostgreSQL would
    throw an error, and any page containing that comment would
    not be viewable. On most Bugzillas, any user can enter
    a comment on any bug, so any user could have used this to
    deny access to one or all bugs. Bugzillas running on
    databases other than PostgreSQL are not affected.
