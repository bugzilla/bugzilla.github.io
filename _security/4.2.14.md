  description: |-
    Login names (usually an email address) longer than 127
    characters are silently truncated in MySQL which could
    cause the domain name of the email address to be
    corrupted. An attacker could use this vulnerability to
    create an account with an email address different from the
    one originally requested. The login name could then be
    automatically added to groups based on the group's regular
    expression setting.
