    The names of all products are exposed on show_bug.cgi to any user
    who can edit bugs, even products that are normally invisible
    to that user.

  fixed-in: 3.4.1
  description: |-
    Normally, users are only supposed to see products that
    they can file bugs against in the "Product" drop-down
    on the bug-editing page. Instead, users were being shown
    all products, even those that they normally could not
    see. Any user who could edit any bug could see all product
    names.
