title: "3.0.3, 3.1.3, 2.22.3, and 2.20.5 Security Advisory"
versions: ["3.0.4", "3.1.4", "2.22.4", "2.20.6"]
date: 2008-05-04
bugs:
- summary: |-
    Users without the "canconfirm" privilege could enter a bug as NEW
    or ASSIGNED by using the XML-RPC interface.
  class: Unauthorized Bug Change
  affected: 3.1.3
  description: |-
    Users normally need the "canconfirm" privilege to put bugs
    in the NEW or ASSIGNED state. However, users were being 
    allowed to create bugs in the NEW or ASSIGNED state if they
    were creating the bug through the XML-RPC interface.

- summary: |-
    When viewing several bugs at once, there was a Cross-Site Scripting hole.
  class: Cross-Site Scripting
  affected: 2.17.2 and higher
  description: |-
    When using the "Format for Printing" view of a bug (or
    the "Long Format" of a bug list, which is the same thing),
    there was a cross-site scripting hole--arbitrary text
    from a particular URL parameter could be injected into the
    page without filtering.

- summary: |-
    The inbound email interface allowed you to set the Reporter via the
    text of the email, instead of just using the From header.
  class: Account Impersonation (Minor)
  affected: 2.23.4 and higher
  description: |-
    By design, email_in.pl always believes the "From" header as
    the user making changes or uses that as the reporter of the
    bug. However, you could also specify the changer/reporter in
    the body of the email and override the "From" header, possibly
    bypassing some security checks set up by administrators
    against the "From" header.
    For most installations this is a minor or inconsequential
    issue, as the documentation of email_in.pl already explains
    that it does not do any user authentication (it just
    believes the "From" header), so installations using it should
    not have been expecting user account security (though they
    may have had checks against the "From" header--that is what
    makes this a security issue).
