versions: ["2.20.4", "2.22.2", "2.23.4"]
date: 2007-02-02
bugs:
- summary: |-
    A possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Atom feeds
    produced by Bugzilla.
  class: Cross-Site Scripting
  affected: 2.20.1 and above
  description: |-
    Bugzilla does not properly escape some fields in generated
    Atom feeds, which leads to the potential for cross-site
    scripting in feed readers that support javascript and
    properly implement the Atom feed specification.

- summary: |-
    Web server settings given by Bugzilla which provide security settings
    to protect data files from access via the web are overridden by the
    mod_perl startup script when running under mod_perl (development
    snapshot only).
  class: Database password disclosure
  affected: 2.23.3 only
  description: |-
    Bugzilla development snapshot version 2.23.3 introduced
    the ability to run Bugzilla under mod_perl on Apache.
    The mod_perl initialization script included with Bugzilla
    defines a new <Directory> block in the Apache configuration
    for the directory containing Bugzilla. This block fails to
    include permission for .htaccess files to override file
    access permissions.  The .htaccess file shipped with
    Bugzilla prohibits access by web browsers to read the
    localconfig file, which contains the username and password
    for connecting to the database server.
    If you are not running Bugzilla under mod_perl, then this
    does not affect you.
