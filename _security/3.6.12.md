title: "4.4rc1, 4.2.4, 4.0.9, and 3.6.12 Security Advisory"
versions: ["3.6.13", "4.0.10", "4.2.5", "4.4rc2"]
date: 2013-02-19
bugs:
- summary: |-
    When viewing a bug report, a bug ID containing random code is not
    correctly sanitized in the HTML page if the specified page format
    is invalid. This can lead to XSS.
  class: Cross-Site Scripting
  affected: 2.0 to 3.6.12, 3.7.1 to 4.0.9, 4.1.1 to 4.2.4,
    4.3.1 to 4.4rc1
  fixed-in: 3.6.13, 4.0.10, 4.2.5, 4.4rc2
  description: |-
    When viewing a single bug report, which is the default,
    the bug ID is validated and rejected if it is invalid.
    But when viewing several bug reports at once, which is
    specified by the format=multiple parameter, invalid bug
    IDs can go through and are sanitized in the HTML page
    itself. But when an invalid page format is passed to the
    CGI script, the wrong HTML page is called and data are not
    correctly sanitized, which can lead to XSS.
