date: 2010-11-02
bugs:
- summary: |-
    There is a way to inject both headers and content to users, causing
    a serious Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
  class: HTTP Response Splitting
  affected: Every Version Before 3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, 4.0rc1
  fixed-in: 3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, 4.0rc1
  description: |-
    By inserting a certain string into a URL, it was possible
    to inject both headers and content to any browser that
    supported "Server Push" (mostly only Gecko-based browsers
    like Firefox). This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting
    vulnerabilities, and possibly other more dangerous
    security issues as well.

- summary: |-
    It was possible to see graphs from Old Charts even if you did not
    have access to a particular product, and you could browse a
    particular URL to see all product names.
  class: Information Leak
  affected: 2.12 to 3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3, 4.1
  fixed-in: 3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, 4.0rc1
  description: |-
    The Old Charts system generated graphs with
    predictable names into the "graphs/" directory,
    which also could be browsed to see its contents.
    This allowed unauthorized users to see product names
    and charted information about those products over time.
