title: "3.2.1, 3.0.7, and 3.3.2 Security Advisory"
versions: ["3.2.2", "3.0.8", "3.3.3"]
date: 2009-02-03
bugs:
- summary: |-
    Bugzilla 3.2.1, 3.0.7, and 3.3.2, when running under mod_perl,
    generated insufficiently random numbers, resulting in all random
    tokens being the same, all CSRF protection being defeated, and the
    new attachment_base functionality being compromised. Only these
    releases were affected--earlier releases are not affected.
  class: Insufficiently Random Numbers
  affected: 3.2.1, 3.0.7, and 3.3.2
  fixed-in: 3.2.2, 3.0.8, 3.3.3
  description: |-
    Bugzilla was calling srand() at compile time. Under
    mod_perl, this led to all Apache children having the same
    random seed, meaning that they all generated identical
    "random" strings instead of actually random strings.

    This means that all tokens were highly predictable, all
    CSRF protection was easily circumvented, and any
    installation using the new attachment_base functionality
    could possibly have any private attachment viewed without
    the user even logging in.

    Versions before 3.2.1, 3.0.7, and 3.3.2 were not
    affected. Installations that are not using mod_perl
    for Bugzilla are not affected.
