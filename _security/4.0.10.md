title: "4.4.1, 4.2.7, and 4.0.11 Security Advisory"
versions: ["4.0.11", "4.2.7", "4.4.1"]
date: 2013-10-16
bugs:
- summary: |-
    A CSRF vulnerability in process_bug.cgi affecting Bugzilla 4.4 only
    can lead to a bug being edited without the user consent.
  class: Cross-Site Request Forgery
  affected: 4.4rc1 to 4.4
  fixed-in: 4.4.1
  description: |-
    When a user submits changes to a bug right after another
    user did, a midair collision page is displayed to inform
    the user about changes recently made. This page contains
    a token which can be used to validate the changes if the
    user decides to submit his changes anyway. A regression
    in Bugzilla 4.4 caused this token to be recreated if a
    crafted URL was given, even when no midair collision page
    was going to be displayed, allowing an attacker to bypass
    the token check and abuse a user to commit changes on his
    behalf.

  description: |-
    When an attachment is edited, a token is generated to

    an attacker could force the token to be recreated,
    allowing him to bypass the token check and abuse a user
    to commit changes on his behalf.
