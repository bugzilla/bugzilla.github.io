- summary: |-
    Bug reporters could confirm their bugs and change their bugs'
    statuses, even if they didn't have the appropriate permissions.
  class: Unauthorized Bug Change
  affected: 3.1.1 through 3.2.3, 3.3.1 through 3.3.4
  fixed-in: 3.2.4, 3.4rc1
  description: |-
    Users could, in some situations, confirm bugs even if they
    weren't in the canconfirm group, or set a bug to statuses
    that they normally didn't have access to. (For example,
    bug reporters who had no permissions could set their bug
    to any status, while they are only supposed to be able to
    close their bug.)
