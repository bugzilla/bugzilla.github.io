versions: ["3.4.14", "3.6.8", "4.0.4", "4.2rc2"]
date: 2012-01-31
bugs:
- summary: |-
    When a user creates a new account, Bugzilla doesn't correctly
    reject email addresses containing non-ASCII characters, which
    could be used to impersonate another user account.
  class: Account Impersonation 
  affected: 2.0 to 3.4.13, 3.5.1 to 3.6.7, 3.7.1 to 4.0.3, 4.1.1 to 4.2rc1
  fixed-in: 3.4.14, 3.6.8, 4.0.4, 4.2rc2
  description: |-
    When a user creates a new account, Bugzilla doesn't
    correctly reject email addresses containing non-ASCII
    characters, which could be used to impersonate another
    user account. Such email addresses could look visually
    identical to other valid email addresses, and an attacker
    could try to confuse other users and be added to bugs he
    shouldn't have access to.

- summary: |-
    A CSRF vulnerability in the implementation of the JSON-RPC API
    could be used to make changes to bugs or execute some admin tasks
    without the victim's knowledge.
  class: Cross-Site Request Forgery
  affected: 3.5.1 to 3.6.7, 3.7.1 to 4.0.3, 4.1.1 to 4.2rc1
  fixed-in: 3.6.8, 4.0.4, 4.2rc2
  description: |-
    Due to a lack of validation of the Content-Type header
    when making POST requests to jsonrpc.cgi, a possible
    CSRF vulnerability was discovered. If a user visits an
    HTML page with some malicious JS code in it, an attacker
    could make changes to a remote Bugzilla installation on
    behalf of the victim's account by using the JSON-RPC API.
    The user would have had to be already logged in to the
    target site for the vulnerability to work.
