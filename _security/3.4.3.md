- summary: |-
    Aliases of hidden bugs would show up in the "Depends On" and "Blocks"
    list of other bugs, even if you didn't have permission to see the
    hidden bugs.
  class: Information Leak
  affected: 3.3.2 to 3.4.3, 3.5 to 3.5.1
  fixed-in: 3.4.4, 3.5.2
  description: |-
    When a bug is in a group, none of its information
    (other than its status and resolution) should be visible
    to users outside that group. It was discovered that
    as of 3.3.2, Bugzilla was showing the alias of the bug 
    (a very short string used as a shortcut for looking up
    the bug) to users outside of the group, if the protected
    bug ended up in the "Depends On" or "Blocks" list of any
    other bug.
