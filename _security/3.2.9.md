  description: |-
    It was possible for a user to gain unauthorized access to
    any Bugzilla account in a very short amount of time (short
    enough that the attack is highly effective). This is a
    critical vulnerability that should be patched immediately
    by all Bugzilla installations.

  cve: CVE-2010-4570
  reported-by: Reed Loden
  fixed-by: Guy Pyrzak, Max Kanat-Alexander, Frédéric Buclin
- summary: |-
    If you put a harmful "javascript:" or "data:" URL into Bugzilla's
    "URL" field, then there are multiple situations in which Bugzilla
    will unintentionally make that link clickable.
  class: Cross-Site Scripting
  affected: Every Version Before 3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
  fixed-in: 3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
  description: |-
    Bugzilla has a "URL" field that can contain several types
    of URL, including "javascript:" and "data:" URLs. However,
    it does not make "javascript:" and "data:" URLs into
    clickable links, to protect against cross-site scripting
    attacks or other attacks. It was possible to bypass this
    protection by adding spaces into the URL in places that
    Bugzilla did not expect them. Also, "javascript:" and 
    "data:" links were *always- summary: |-
    shown as clickable to
    logged-out users.

- summary: |-
    Various pages lack protection against cross-site request forgeries.
  class: Cross-Site Request Forgery
  affected: Every Version Before 3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
  fixed-in: 3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
  description: |-
    Various pages were vulnerable to Cross-Site Request 
    Forgery attacks. Most of these issues are not as serious
    as previous CSRF vulnerabilities. Some of these issues
    were only addressed on more recent branches of Bugzilla
    and not fixed in earlier branches, in order to avoid
    changing behavior that external applications may depend
    on. The links below in "References" describe which issues
    were fixed on which branches.
