<h1>2.14.2, 2.16rc2 Security Advisory</h1>
Jun 8th, 2002<br/>
<pre>
All Bugzilla installations are advised to upgrade to the latest versions
of Bugzilla released today, 2.14.2 and 2.16rc2.

Various security issues of varying importance have been fixed in
Bugzilla 2.14.2.  Most of these were fixed already in 2.16rc1, a few
were not.

Hence, if you are running 2.14.1 or earlier, it is advised you upgrade
to 2.14.2.  Whereas if you were running 2.15 or 2.16rc1, it is advised
you upgrade to 2.16rc2.

There are many patches that need to be applied to properly close these
holes, so they are not included here.  If you will not be upgrading your
system and instead wish to apply these patches to your existing system, a 
single patch which can be applied to a Bugzilla 2.14.1 installation is 
available at
 https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/webtools/bugzilla-2.14.1-to-2.14.2.diff.gz
and a patch which can be applied to a Bugzilla 2.14 installation is at
 https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/webtools/bugzilla-2.14-to-2.14.2.diff.gz

Full downloads (rather than patches) are available at
 https://www.bugzilla.org/download.html

Complete bug reports for all bugs can be obtained by visiting the
following URL:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=XXXXX
where you replace the XXXXX at the end of the URL with a bug number as   
listed below.  You may also enter the bug numbers in the "enter a bug#" box
on the main page at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/ or in the footer of any
other page on bugzilla.mozilla.org.

A complete list of issues solved in 2.14.2 follows:

- queryhelp.cgi no longer shows confidential products to
  people it shouldn't.
  (bug 126801)

- It was possible for a user to bypass the IP check by
  setting up a fake reverse DNS, if the Bugzilla web server
  was configured to do reverse DNS lookups.  Apache is not
  configured as such by default.  This is not a complete
  exploit, as the user's login cookie would also need to
  be divulged for this to be a problem.
  (bug 129466)

- In some situations the data directory became world writeable.
  (bug 134575)

- Any user with access to editusers.cgi could delete a user
  regardless of whether 'allowuserdeletion' is on.
  (bug 141557)

- Real names were not HTML filtered, causing possible cross
  site scripting attacks.
  (bug 146447, 147486)

- Mass change would set the groupset of every bug to be the
  groupset of the first bug.
  (bug 107718)

- Some browsers (eg NetPositive) interacted with Bugzilla
  badly and could have various form problems, including
  removing group restrictions on bugs.
  (bug 148674)

- It was possible for random confidential information to be
  divulged, if the shadow database was in use and became
  corrupted.
  (bug 92263)

- The bug list sort order is now stricter about the SQL it will accept,
  ensuring you use correct column name syntax.  Before this, there were
  some syntax checks, so it is not known whether this problem was
  exploitable.
  (bug 130821)
