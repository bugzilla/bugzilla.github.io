title: "3.0.10, 3.2.5, 3.4.4, and 3.5.2 Security Advisory"
versions: ["3.0.11", "3.2.6", "3.4.5", "3.5.3"]
date: 2010-01-31
bugs:
- summary: |-
    Some files stored on the web server are not correctly protected against
    external access and can be viewed from a web browser.
  class: Information leak
  affected: all versions before 3.0.11, 3.2.6, 3.4.5, and 3.5.3
  description: |-
    Bugzilla allows web browsers to serve the contents of files
    in the CVS/, contrib/, docs/en/xml/, and t/ directories, as
    well as the old-params.txt file.
    These files do not contain sensitive data by default, but
    custom installations may have added scripts or files into
    these directories which contain e.g. passwords or some other
    sensitive information. We now forbird access to these
    directories from a web browser as a preventive measure.

  cve: CVE-2009-3989
  reported-by: Joel Peshkin, Frédéric Buclin
  fixed-by: Frédéric Buclin, Max Kanat-Alexander, Reed Loden
- summary: |-
    Restricting a bug to a group while moving the bug to another product has
    no effect if the group is not used by both products. The bug may become
    public if no other group restriction applies.
  class: Information leak
  affected: 3.3.1 to 3.4.4, 3.5.1, 3.5.2
  description: |-
    When moving a bug from one product to another, an intermediate
    page is displayed letting you select the groups the bug should
    be restricted to in the new product. However, a regression in
    the 3.4.x series made it ignore all groups which are not
    available in both products. As a workaround, you had to move
    the bug to the new product first and then restrict it to the
    desired groups, in two distinct steps, which could make the bug
    temporarily public.
