title: "4.1.2, 4.0.1, 3.6.5, and 3.4.11 Security Advisory"
versions: ["3.4.12", "3.6.6", "4.0.2", "4.1.3"]
date: 2011-08-04
bugs:
- summary: |-
    Internet Explorer 8 and older, and Safari before 5.0.6 do content
    sniffing when viewing a patch in "Raw Unified" mode, which could
    trigger a cross-site scripting attack due to the execution of
    malicious code in the attachment.
  class: Cross-Site Scripting
  affected: 2.4 to 3.4.11, 3.5.1 to 3.6.5, 3.7.1 to 4.0.1, 4.1.1 to 4.1.2
  fixed-in: 3.4.12, 3.6.6, 4.0.2, 4.1.3
  description: |-
    Bugzilla uses an alternate host for attachments when
    viewing them in raw format to prevent cross-site scripting
    attacks. This alternate host is now also used when viewing
    patches in "Raw Unified" mode because Internet Explorer 8
    and older, and Safari before 5.0.6 do content sniffing,
    which could lead to the execution of malicious code.

  cve: CVE-2011-2379
  reported-by: Neal Poole
  fixed-by: Byron Jones, Reed Loden, Max Kanat-Alexander, Frédéric Buclin
- summary: |-
    It is possible to determine whether or not certain group names exist
    while creating or updating bugs; and in Bugzilla 4.1.1 and 4.1.2,
    also by using custom searches.
  class: Information Leak
  affected: 2.23.3 to 3.4.11, 3.5.1 to 3.6.5, 3.7.1 to 4.0.1, 4.1.1 to 4.1.2
  fixed-in: 3.4.12, 3.6.6, 4.0.2, 4.1.3
  description: |-
    Normally, a group name is confidential and is only visible
    to members of the group, and to non-members if the group
    is used in bugs. By crafting the URL when creating or
    editing a bug, it was possible to guess if a group existed
    or not, even for groups which weren't used in bugs and so
    which were supposed to remain confidential.
    Moreover, in Bugzilla 4.1.1 and 4.1.2, custom searches also
    let you determine if a group exists or not, even for groups
    which should remain confidential.

- summary: |-
    Attachment descriptions with a newline in them could lead to the
    injection of crafted headers in email notifications sent to the
    requestee or the requester when editing an attachment flag.
  class: Email Header Injection
  affected: 2.17.1 to 3.4.11, 3.5.1 to 3.6.5, 3.7.1 to 4.0.1, 4.1.1 to 4.1.2
  fixed-in: 3.4.12, 3.6.6, 4.0.2, 4.1.3
  description: |-
    Bugzilla mostly sends two types of email notifications:
    bugmails and flagmails. A bugmail is the standard email
    users get when a change is made to a bug. A flagmail is
    only sent to the requestee or requester of a flag. For
    flagmails only, attachment descriptions with a newline
    in them could lead to the injection of crafted headers in
    email notifications when an attachment flag is edited.
    Other users only receiving a bugmail are not affected.

  cve: CVE-2011-2381
  reported-by: Neil Rashbrook
  fixed-by: Frédéric Buclin, Reed Loden, Max Kanat-Alexander, Byron Jones
- summary: |-
    If an attacker has access to a user's session, he can modify that
    user's email address without that user being notified of the change.
  class: Unnotified Account Change
  affected: 2.16rc1 to 3.4.11, 3.5.1 to 3.6.5, 3.7.1 to 4.0.1, 4.1.1 to 4.1.2
  fixed-in: 3.4.12, 3.6.6, 4.0.2, 4.1.3
  description: |-
    When a user changes his email address, Bugzilla trusts
    a user-modifiable field for obtaining the current e-mail
    address to send a confirmation message to. If an attacker
    has access to the session of another user (for example,
    if that user left their browser window open in a public
    place), the attacker could alter this field to cause
    the email-change notification to go to their own address.
    This means that the user would not be notified that his
    account had its email address changed by the attacker.

  cve: CVE-2011-2978
  reported-by: Reed Loden
  fixed-by: Byron Jones, Max Kanat-Alexander, Frédéric Buclin
- summary: |-
    Temporary files for uploaded attachments are not deleted on Windows,
    which could let a user with local access to the server read them.
  class: Local Information Disclosure
  affected: 3.6 to 3.6.5, 3.7.1 to 4.0.1, 4.1.1 to 4.1.2
  fixed-in: 3.6.6, 4.0.2, 4.1.3
  description: |-
    Temporary files for uploaded attachments are not deleted
    on Windows. A user with local access to the server could
    read these attachments even if he wouldn't normally be
    allowed to view them from Bugzilla.

  cve: CVE-2011-2977
  reported-by: Frédéric Buclin
  fixed-by: Frédéric Buclin, Byron Jones
- summary: |-
    Up to Bugzilla 3.4.11, if a BUGLIST cookie is compromised, it can
    be used to inject HTML code when viewing a bug report, leading to
    a cross-site scripting attack.
  class: Cross-Site Scripting
  affected: 2.16rc1 to 3.4.11
  fixed-in: 3.4.12
  description: |-
    If a BUGLIST cookie is compromised (which is not possible
    except via a vulnerability outside of Bugzilla), it can be
    used to inject HTML code when viewing a bug report, leading
    to a cross-site scripting attack.
    Bugzilla 3.5.1 and above are not affected by this issue.
