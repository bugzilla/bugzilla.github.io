title: "2.18.5, 2.20.2, 2.22, and 2.23.2 Security Advisory"
versions: ["2.18.6", "2.20.3", "2.22.1", "2.23.3"]
date: 2006-10-15
bugs:
- summary: |-
    Sometimes the information put into the &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h2&gt; tags in Bugzilla
    was not properly escaped, leading to a possible XSS vulnerability.
  class: Cross-Site Scripting
  affected: 2.15 and above
  description: |-
    Bugzilla sometimes displays admin-provided data in page 
    headers (meaning the &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h2&gt; HTML tags of a page).
    Sometimes, this data was not properly escaped, leading to 
    the possibility of a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
    For the most part, this was only exploitable by 
    administrators, and so is not of critical severity.

- summary: |-
    Bugzilla administrators were allowed to put raw, unfiltered HTML into
    many fields in Bugzilla, leading to a possible XSS vulnerability. 
    Now, the HTML allowed in those fields is limited.
  class: Cross-Site Scripting
  affected: 2.0 and above
  description: |-
    Bugzilla allows administrators to put HTML in the
    descriptions of products, components, and other items. It
    also allows HTML in certain other fields. Before the
    most recent releases of Bugzilla, this HTML was completely
    unfiltered. These fields are only editable by
    certain users, who are specified by the admin. This makes
    this vulnerability less severe. However, these users could
    use this exploit to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks
    on nearly all users of a particular Bugzilla (including
    users with higher permission levels than themselves).

    Bugzilla now allows only certain HTML tags in those fields,
    protecting users from a Cross-Site Scripting attack.

- summary: |-
    attachment.cgi could leak the names of private attachments
  class: Information Leak
  affected: 2.17 and above
  description: |-
    When viewing an attachment in "Diff" mode, a user who is
    not in the "insidergroup" (the group required to view
    private attachments) can read the one-line descriptions
    of all attachments, even "private" attachments.

- summary: |-
    The "deadline" field was visible in the XML format of a bug, even to
    users who were not a member of the "timetrackinggroup."
  class: Information Leak
  affected: 2.19.2 and above
  description: |-
    Bugzilla has a "deadline" field, which is usually only
    visible to people in the "timetrackinggroup" group.
    However, it was exposed in the XML format of a bug to all
    users.

- summary: |-
    A malicious user could pass a URL to an admin, and make the admin
    delete or change something that he had not intended to delete or 
    change.
  class: Security Enhancement
  affected: 2.0 and above
  description: |-
    Bugzilla updates, deletes, and creates data through a
    web interface. Administrators update things like user
    accounts through this interface. All of these pages accept
    URL variables in both GET and POST formats.

    A malicious user could craft a URL that would edit a user
    (or any other admin-protected item), and then using a
    service like TinyURL, could obscure the URL so that an
    administrator couldn't tell what it was. Then, getting the
    administrator to click on that URL, the action would be
    performed, against the administrator's will.

    This is now prevented. Bugzilla will only accept changes
    on administrative pages if they come from Bugzilla's own
    forms. That is, you have to use the form to make changes--
    you now cannot just click a URL and accidentally make an
    administrative change to Bugzilla.

    Although technically this affects all versions of Bugzilla,
    it has only been fixed on our most recent release (2.22.1
    and our latest development snapshot, 2.23.3), because the
    fix was too invasive to backport further. Administrators
    of previous versions of Bugzilla should only click on URLs
    from users that they fully trust.

- summary: |-
    It is possible to inject arbitrary HTML into the showdependencygraph.cgi
    page, allowing for a cross-site scripting attack.
  class: Cross-Site Scripting
  affected: 2.15 and above
  description: |-
    showdependencygraph.cgi is a script that allows you to display
    a graph of how bugs are related. There is a cross-site
    scripting vulnerability in this script that allows for arbitrary
    HTML injection. The user would have to follow a malicious URL
    in order to trigger the attack--it is not possible for another
    user to otherwise inject HTML into the page for the current
    user.
