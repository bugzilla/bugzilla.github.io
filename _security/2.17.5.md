- summary: |-
    This advisory covers a security bug which was accidently introduced in
    development version 2.17.5 and subsequently fixed in the Bugzilla code
    involving unprivileged access to restricted data.
  class: Information leak
  affected: 2.17.5 is the only version affected.
  description: |-
    A new feature was introduced in version 2.17.5 which allows
    remote websites to build tooltips and other dynamically
    generated data using current bug information retrieved from
    Bugzilla.  A security lapse in the initial implementation
    of this feature allows the remote site to obtain that
    information from Bugzilla using the privileges of the
    client user.
