title: "3.0.4, 3.1.4, and 2.22.4 Security Advisory"
versions: ["3.0.5", "3.2rc1", "2.22.4"]
date: 2008-08-12
bugs:
- summary: |-
    Local files on the server can be attached to a bug (making them
    publicly visible) when importing bugs with --attach_path
  class: Directory Traversal
  affected: 2.22.1 - 2.22.4, 2.23.3 and higher
  description: |-
    When importing bugs using importxml.pl, the --attach_path
    option can be specified, pointing to the directory where
    attachments to import are stored. If the XML file being
    read by importxml.pl contains a malicious
    &lt;data encoding="filename"&gt;../relative_path/to/local_file&lt;/data&gt;
    node, the script follows this relative path and attaches the
    local file pointed by it to the bug, making the file public.
    The security fix makes sure the relative path is always
    ignored.
    Most Bugzilla installations will not be vulnerable, as
    they do not use --attach_path with importxml.pl.
    (In fact, most installations don't use importxml.pl at all.)
