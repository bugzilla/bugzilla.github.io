<h1>Bugzilla Security Advisory</h1>
 Aug 30th, 2001<br/>
 Author: <a href="mailto:matty@chariot.net.au">Matthew Tuck</a>
<br/>
<h2>Overview</h2>
 Users of Bugzilla are recommended to update to version 2.14.<br/>
<br/>
 Bugzilla 2.14 is a general security update, but not all of the security
issues are serious.<br/>
<br/>
 Serious issues include:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple instances where data on "confidential" bugs could be obtained
by valid users of the system not authorised to.</li>
  <li>Multiple instances of security holes where parameters were not being
checked/escaped properly.</li>
</ul>
 There are many patches that need to be applied to properly close these holes, 
so they are not included here. &nbsp;If you will not be upgrading your system 
to 2.14 and instead wish to apply these patches to your existing system, please
consult the <a href="/releases/2.14/">release notes</a>
  for the bug numbers of these bugs on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">
bugzilla.mozilla.org</a>
  where you can obtain the patches attached to bugs.
