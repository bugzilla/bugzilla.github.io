title: "2.18.1 and 2.19.3 Security Advisory"
versions: ["2.18.2", "2.20rc1"]
date: 2005-07-07
bugs:
- summary: |-
    Any user can change a flag on any bug. This also allows the 
    attacker to expose the summary of any bug, even a hidden bug.
  class: Unauthorized Bug Change, Information Leak
  affected: 2.17.1 - 2.18.1, 2.19.1 - 2.19.3
  description: |-
    Any user can change any flag on any bug, even if they don't
    have access to that bug, or even if they can't normally
    make bug changes. This also allows them to expose the
    summary of a bug.
    By manually modifying a link to process_bug.cgi, it is possible
    to change a flag on a bug that you do not have access to,
    because Bugzilla does not validate that the flag you are 
    attempting to change is associated with the bug that you 
    are attempting to change.
    If the attacker makes a flag change which causes the attacker
    to be emailed, the attacker will see the summary of the bug
    in that email.
    If you are using the request_group or grant_group features
    of 2.19, the attacker will be prevented from exploiting
    this security hole if they do not have permission to
    change the flag in the fashion that they are changing it.

- summary: |-
    Summaries of private bugs are sometimes exposed under a very rare
    condition if you use MySQL replication.
  class: Information Leak
  affected: 2.17.1 and above
  description: |-
    Bugs are inserted into the database before they are marked
    as private, in Bugzilla code. Thus, MySQL replication can
    lag in between the time that the bug is inserted and when
    it is marked as private (usually less than a second). If
    replication lags at this point, the bug summary will be 
    accessible to all users until replication catches up.
    Also, on a very slow machine, there may be a pause
    longer than a second that allows users to see the title of
    the newly-filed bug.
