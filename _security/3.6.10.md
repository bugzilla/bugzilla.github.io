  cve: CVE-2012-3981
  reported-by: Frédéric Buclin
  fixed-by: Frédéric Buclin, Reed Loden
- summary: |-
    Extensions are not protected against directory browsing by default
    and users can view the source code of templates used by the
    extensions. These templates may contain sensitive data.
  class: Directory Browsing
  affected: 2.23.2 to 3.6.10, 3.7.1 to 4.0.7, 4.1.1 to 4.2.2, 4.3.1 to 4.3.2
  fixed-in: 4.0.8, 4.2.3, 4.3.3
  description: |-
    Extensions are not protected against directory browsing
    and users can access the source code of the templates
    which may contain sensitive data.
    Directory browsing is blocked in Bugzilla 4.3.3 only,
    because it requires a configuration change in the Apache
    httpd.conf file to allow local .htaccess files to use
    Options -Indexes. To not break existing installations,
    this fix has not been backported to stable branches.
    The access to templates is blocked for all supported
    branches except the old 3.6 branch, because this branch
    doesn't have .htaccess in the bzr repository and cannot
    be fixed easily for existing installations without
    potentially conflicting with custom changes.
