title: "3.2, 3.0.6, 2.22.6, and 3.3.1 Security Advisory"
versions: ["3.2.1", "3.0.7", "2.22.7", "3.3.2"]
date: 2009-02-02
bugs:
- summary: |-
    It was possible for users to upload a malicious attachment to
    that would run in the context of Bugzilla's domain (thus 
    circumventing cross-site request protections in browsers).
  class: Abuse of Functionality (Attachments)
  affected: Every version before 2.22.7, 3.0.7, 3.2.1, or 3.3.2
  fixed-in: 2.22.7, 3.0.7, 3.2.1, 3.3.2
  description: |-
    Bugzilla users can upload HTML or JavaScript attachments
    that are then viewed by other users in their web browsers.
    A malicious user could trick another Bugzilla user into
    viewing a malicious attachment that could then operate
    as that user. Since Bugzilla would view attachments
    using the same domain name as the rest of the application,
    such malicious attachments could access the cookies of
    the user and perform other activities usually restricted
    by the cross-site request protections of web browsers.

    Bugzilla now provides a two-fold solution to this problem:

    Bugzilla 2.22.7, 3.0.7, 3.2.1, and 3.3.2 now prevent
    users from viewing attachments in their browsers, by
    default. There is a new parameter named
    "allow_attachment_display" that administrators can enable
    to override this protection.

    Once this parameter is turned on, Bugzilla 3.0.7, 3.2.1,
    and 3.3.2 allow administrators to specify that attachments
    should be viewed using a different domain. This increases
    safety for the end user by enabling the browser's
    cross-domain request protections.

- summary: |-
    Bug updating was vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery.
    Note that this issue was only fixed for 3.2.1 and 3.3.2 even though
    all versions of Bugzilla are affected (see below for an explanation).
  class: Cross-Site Request Forgery
  affected: Every version before 3.2.1 or 3.3.2
  fixed-in: 3.2.1, 3.3.2
  description: |-
    Bug updating was vulnerable to a cross-site request
    forgery, because it did not validate that calls to
    process_bug.cgi actually came from Bugzilla.

    Bugzilla now generates a token that is validated when
    process_bug.cgi is called. This may break automated
    scripts that call process_bug.cgi directly, unless they
    first load show_bug.cgi to get a valid token.

    Unfortunately, a fix for this issue was only possible for
    3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Fixing it on earlier branches would have
    broken Bugzilla's mid-air collision functionality.

    It should be noted that this issue actually was not a
    secret--it has been public knowledge for quite some time.
    It is only included in this security advisory to note that
    a fix is now available.

- summary: |-
    Keywords, unused flag types, and saved searches could be deleted via
    cross-site request forgery. Also, a user's preferences could be
    changed via cross-site request forgery.
  class: Cross-Site Request Forgery
  affected: All Versions (for keywords and user preferences), 2.17 
    and higher (for flags), 3.0 and higher (for saved
    searches)
  fixed-in: 2.22.7, 3.0.7, 3.2.1, 3.3.2
  description: |-
    When deleting saved searches, keywords, or unused 
    (never set on any bug or attachment) flags, or when a user
    updated their preferences, Bugzilla did not properly 
    validate that the request came from Bugzilla. So, it was
    possible to trick a user into click on a link that would
    perform these actions without their consent.
