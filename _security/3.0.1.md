title: "3.0.1 and 3.1.1 Security Advisory"
versions: ["3.0.2", "3.1.2"]
date: 2007-09-18
bugs:
- summary: |-
    Even with account creation disabled, users can use the WebService to
    create an account.
  class: Unauthorized Access
  affected: 2.23.3 and above.
  description: |-
    Bugzilla::WebService::User::offer_account_by_email does
    not check the "createemailregexp" parameter, and thus
    allows users to create accounts who would normally be
    denied account creation.
    The "emailregexp" parameter is still checked.
    If you do not have the SOAP::Lite Perl module installed on
    your Bugzilla system, your system is not vulnerable
    (because the Bugzilla WebService will not be enabled).
