title: "4.2.rc2 and 4.0.4 Security Advisory"
versions: ["4.0.5", "4.2"]
date: 2012-02-22
bugs:
- summary: |-
    A CSRF vulnerability in the implementation of the XML-RPC API
    when running under mod_perl could be used to make changes to
    bugs or execute some admin tasks without the victim's knowledge.
  class: Cross-Site Request Forgery
  affected: 4.0.2 to 4.0.4, 4.1.1 to 4.2rc2
  fixed-in: 4.0.5, 4.2
  description: |-
    Due to a lack of validation of the enctype form
    attribute when making POST requests to xmlrpc.cgi,
    a possible CSRF vulnerability was discovered. If a user
    visits an HTML page with some malicious HTML code in it,
    an attacker could make changes to a remote Bugzilla installation
    on behalf of the victim's account by using the XML-RPC API
    on a site running mod_perl. Sites running under mod_cgi
    are not affected. Also the user would have had to be
    already logged in to the target site for the vulnerability
    to work.
