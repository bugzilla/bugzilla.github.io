title: "3.2.2 and 3.3.3 Security Advisory"
versions: ["3.2.3", "3.3.4"]
date: 2009-03-30
bugs:
- summary: |-
    Attachment editing was vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery.
    Note that this issue was only fixed for 3.2.3 and 3.3.4 even though
    all versions of Bugzilla are affected (see below for an explanation).
  class: Cross-Site Request Forgery
  affected: Every version before 3.2.3 or 3.3.4
  fixed-in: 3.2.3, 3.3.4
  description: |-
    Attachment editing was vulnerable to a cross-site request
    forgery, because it did not validate that calls to
    attachment.cgi actually came from Bugzilla.

    Bugzilla now generates a token that is validated when
    an attachment is edited. Unfortunately, a fix for this issue
    was only possible for 3.2.3 and 3.3.4. Fixing it on earlier
    branches was not possible as attachment timestamps are not
    available to generate and validate tokens.
