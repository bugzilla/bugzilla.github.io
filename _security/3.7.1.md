title: "3.7.1 Security Advisory"
versions: ["3.7.2"]
date: 2010-07-05
bugs:
- summary: |-
    In the 3.7.1 development snapshot, adding bugs using email_in.pl
    or the WebServices Bug.create method would not restrict bugs to
    Mandatory or Default groups.
  class: Unauthorized Access to Confidential Information
  affects: 3.7, 3.7.1
  fixed-in: 3.7.2
  description: |-
    Bugzilla administrators can set certain groups as being
    "mandatory" for when a new bug is filed. (That is, bugs
    are always restricted to access by those groups.)
    Administrators can also set some groups as "Default",
    meaning that if the user makes no selection about groups,
    the new bug will be restricted to the groups set as
    Default. In the unreleased 3.7 code and 3.7.1 development
    snapshot, restricting a bug to mandatory or default groups
    would not happen when the bug was newly created using the
    inbound email interface (email_in.pl) or the "Bug.create"
    method in the WebServices interface. This means that these
    bugs could be publicly available, when they should have
    been restricted to being accessible only to certain
    groups.
