title: "2.18.3, 2.20rc2, and 2.21 Security Advisory"
versions: ["2.18.4", "2.20", "2.21.1"]
date: 2005-09-30
bugs:
- summary: |-
    config.cgi exposes information to users who aren't logged in, even
    when "requirelogin" is turned on in Bugzilla.
  class: Information Leak
  affected: 2.18rc1 - 2.18.3, 2.19 - 2.20rc2, 2.21
  description: |-
    config.cgi gives JavaScript and RDF information about Bugzilla
    to third-party clients, including a list of products in the
    Bugzilla installation. The "requirelogin" parameter requires
    that all people be logged into Bugzilla before seeing any data,
    as a security measure.
    In affected versions, config.cgi is always accessible, and always
    contains information to non-logged-in users, even when 
    "requirelogin" is turned on, possibly exposing product names that
    administrators expected to be confidential.

- summary: |-
    It is possible to bypass the "user visibility groups" restrictions
    if user-matching is turned on in "substring" mode. 
  class: Information Leak
  affected: 2.19.1 - 2.20rc2, 2.21
  description: |-
    Bugzilla contains features to prevent users from "seeing" other 
    users, enabled by the "usevisibilitygroups" parameter. Bugzilla
    also contains a feature called "user matching," which enables
    users to type in part of a username and get back a list of
    possible matches.
    If user matching is turned on and is in "substring" mode,
    all matching users will be returned to a query, regardless
    of the visibility groups settings, exposing users who should
    be invisible.
