title: "4.5.3, 4.4.3, 4.2.8, and 4.0.12"
versions: ["4.0.12", "4.2.8", "4.4.3", "4.5.3"]
date: 2014-04-17
bugs:
- summary: |-
    The login form had no CSRF protection, meaning that an attacker could
    force the victim to log in using the attacker's credentials.
  class: Cross-Site Request Forgery
  affected: Bugzilla 2.0 to 4.4.2, 4.5.1 to 4.5.2
  fixed-in: 4.4.3, 4.5.3
  description: |-
    The login form had no CSRF protection, meaning that
     an attacker could force the victim to log in using the
     attacker's credentials. If the victim then reports a new
     security sensitive bug, the attacker would get immediate
     access to this bug.
     Due to changes involved in the Bugzilla API, this fix is
     not backported to the 4.0 and 4.2 branches, meaning that
     Bugzilla 4.0.12 and older, and 4.2.8 and older, will
     remain vulnerable to this issue.
