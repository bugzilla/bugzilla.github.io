  cve: CVE-2011-3657
  reported-by: RedTeam Pentesting
  fixed-by: Byron Jones, Frédéric Buclin, Gervase Markham, Reed Loden
- summary: |-
    The User.offer_account_by_email WebService method lets you create
    a new user account even if the active authentication method forbids
    users to create an account.
  class: Unauthorized Account Creation
  affected: 2.23.3 to 3.4.12, 3.5.1 to 3.6.6, 3.7.1 to 4.0.2, 4.1.1 to 4.1.3
  fixed-in: 3.4.13, 3.6.7, 4.0.3, 4.2rc1
  description: |-
    The User.offer_account_by_email WebService method ignores
    the user_can_create_account setting of the authentication
    method and generates an email with a token in it which the
    user can use to create an account. Depending on the
    authentication method being active, this could allow the
    user to log in using this account.
    Installations where the createemailregexp parameter is
    empty are not vulnerable to this issue.

  cve: CVE-2011-3667
  reported-by: Frédéric Buclin
  fixed-by: Frédéric Buclin, Byron Jones, David Lawrence
- summary: |-
    A CSRF vulnerability in post_bug.cgi and in attachment.cgi could
    lead to the creation of unwanted bug reports and attachments.
  class: Cross-Site Request Forgery
  affected: 2.0 to 3.4.12, 3.5.1 to 3.6.6, 3.7.1 to 4.0.2, 4.1.1 to 4.1.3
  fixed-in: 4.2rc1
  description: |-
    The creation of bug reports and of attachments is not
    protected by a token and so they can be created without
    the consent of a user if the relevant code is embedded
    in an HTML page and the user visits this page. This
    behavior was intentional to let third-party applications
    submit new bug reports and attachments easily. But as this
    behavior can be abused by a malicious user, it has been
    decided to block submissions with no valid token starting
    from version 4.2rc1. Older branches are not patched to not
    break these third-party applications after the upgrade.
