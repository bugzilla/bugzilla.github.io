title: "2.18.4, 2.20, and 2.21.1 Security Advisory"
versions: ["2.18.5", "2.20.1", "2.22rc1"]
date: 2006-02-20
bugs:
- summary: |-
    The 'whinedays' and 'mostfreqthreshold' parameters are not correctly
    validated in editparams.cgi. The first one can lead to SQL injection.
  class: SQL injection
  affected: 2.17.1 and above
  description: |-
    The 'whinedays' parameter, editable from editparams.cgi,
    is not validated before being saved. This can lead to SQL
    injection in the whineatnews.pl script. This injection
    requires administrative privileges.
    The validation for the 'mostfreqthreshold' parameter is also
    missing, but this is not exploitable.

- summary: |-
    Escaped HTML markup in titles of RSS feeds are incorrectly decoded by
    some RSS readers and could potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
  class: Cross Site Scripting
  affected: 2.20rc1 - 2.20, 2.21.1
  description: |-
    Some RSS readers incorrectly decode escaped HTML markup in
    feed titles and this could be used to inject some scripts.
    Although this is not a Bugzilla bug, we prefer to shift to
    Atom feeds, where the RFC is unambiguous about HTML markup
    in feed titles.

- summary: |-
    The login form on the home page, in conjuction with very specific
    configuration settings and a specially formed URL, may redirect you
    outside the Bugzilla installation, allowing the login name and password
    to be stolen.
  class: Sensitive Data Exposure
  affected: 2.19.3 and above
  description: |-
    When the Bugzilla login page is at a subdirectory of the web
    server and the subdirectory name is a resolvable host on the
    victim's local network, it is possible to craft a URL that,
    when used to login to Bugzilla, would send the user's
    credentials to this host.
    These conditions make this flaw very difficult to exploit.
