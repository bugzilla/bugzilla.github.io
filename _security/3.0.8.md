title: "3.4.1, 3.2.4, and 3.0.8 Security Advisory"
versions: ["3.4.2", "3.2.5", "3.0.9"]
date: 2009-09-11
bugs:
- summary: |-
    Two SQL injection attacks have been discovered in Bugzilla. One
    only affects the 3.4 series, while the other affects
    the 3.0, 3.2, and 3.4 series. These are extremely serious
    vulnerabilities that must be patched immediately.
  class: SQL Injection
  affected: 3.3.2 to 3.4.1, 3.5
  fixed-in: 3.4.2
  description: |-
    It is possible to inject raw SQL into the Bugzilla 
    database via the Bug.search WebService function. This 
    could be used to expose any data stored in the Bugzilla
    database, including confidential bugs. It is also possible
    that an attacker could modify or delete any data stored in
    the Bugzilla database (though we haven't discovered a
    working exploit that modifies or deletes data).

    The danger of this exploit is slightly lessened by the
    fact that Bugzilla's backend does not accept multiple
    statements separated by a semicolon, so you cannot add
    additional SQL statements (such as a DELETE or INSERT)
    using the exploit. However, this is still an extremely
    critical issue which administrators should patch
    immediately.

- summary: |-

    only affects the 3.4 series, while the other affects
    the 3.0, 3.2, and 3.4 series. These are extremely serious

  class: SQL Injection
  affected: 2.23.4 to 3.0.8, 3.1.1 to 3.2.4, 3.3.1 to 3.4.1
  fixed-in: 3.0.9, 3.2.5, 3.4.2
  description: |-
    It is possible to inject raw SQL into the Bugzilla
    database via the Bug.create WebService function. This
    could be used to expose any data stored in the Bugzilla
    database, including confidential bugs. It is also possible
    that an attacker could modify or delete any data stored in
    the Bugzilla database (though we haven't discovered a
    working exploit that modifies or deletes existing data).

    The danger of this exploit is slightly lessened by the
    fact that Bugzilla's backend does not accept multiple
    statements separated by a semicolon, so you cannot add
    additional SQL statements (such as a DELETE or UPDATE)
    using the exploit.

    This particular hole is much more difficult to exploit
    than the Bug.search one, due to the fact that the SQL
    around the insertion point is highly random, making it
    difficult for an attacker to craft a successful attack.

    However, even considering these factors, this is still an
    extremely critical issue which administrators should patch
    immediately.

  cve: CVE-2009-3165
  reported-by: Max Kanat-Alexander
  fixed-by: Max Kanat-Alexander, Frédéric Buclin
- summary: |-
    When a user would change his password, his new password would
    be exposed in the URL field of the browser if he logged in right
    after changing his password.
  class: Sensitive Data Exposure
  affected: 3.4rc1 to 3.4.1
  fixed-in: 3.4.2
  description: |-
    When a user reset their password and then logged
    in immediately afterward, their password would appear
    in the URL of their browser, which also possibly means
    that that password would appear in the Bugzilla
    webserver's logs and in the Referer header of any page
    whose link was clicked immediately after logging in 
    (although by default Bugzilla only links to itself, on
    that page).
