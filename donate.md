<h3>Ongoing "Nice to have" expenses</h3>

<h4>Permanent developer</h4>

<p>Our pie-in-the-sky goal right now is to have a permanent part-time developer
to work around 20 hours per per week on Bugzilla on whatever needs doing, and
not just one-off projects. To do this, we anticipate needing about $4000 per
month in recurring donations. <b>Until this goal is met, the balance will be
contributed to the general project fund each month (see below).</b> Once the permanant
developer goal is hit, then a permanent developer will be hired, instead.</p>

<p>Single-month recurring donations exceeding the above necessary expenses:</p>

<p>
<a href="https://liberapay.com/bugzilla/" class="button primary">Sponsor Us</a> with a monthly contribution towards this goal at Liberapay using any payment type Stripe will accept (credit, debit, etc). Stripe will deduct 2.9% + 30¢ from your contribution each month as a transaction fee.
</p>

<h4>General project fund</h4>

<p>Any money contributed to this fund will be used towards hiring a developer
to work on code or review submitted patches for one-off projects. Once enough
money collects to be worth funding a project, we'll have someone work on it.</p>

<p>Current accumulated unspent balance of one-time and recurring donations
exceeding the other goals:</p>

<p>
<a href="https://donate.stripe.com/eVadTl5xa53RcIEeUV" class="button primary">Contribute</a> towards this goal via Stripe (credit, debit, Apple Pay, CashApp). Stripe will deduct 2.9% + 30¢ from your contribution as a transaction fee.
</p>
<p>If you give via Stripe and want to cover the fee (completely optional), here's the formula: Take the amount you want us to get, add 30¢, then divide by 0.971.  For example, if you want us to get $100, add 30¢ to make 100.30, then divide by 0.971 and round it to two places after the decimal, which gives you $103.30. To verify it, subtract 2.9% to get 100.3043, round to two digits after the decimal to get 100.30, then subtract 30¢ to get $100.</p>

<h2>Why Bugzilla Now Needs Money</h2>

<p>Historically, most of Bugzilla's development was done by coders who worked
at companies who used Bugzilla, where those companies allowed them to spend
time working on the public version of Bugzilla since it got their features
included in future Bugzilla versions without them having to locally customize
it.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is no longer the case. In the name of immediate productivity,
some companies decide that they can get the quickest results by customizing
their local copy only for their own use, and not taking the time to contribute
those changes to the public version. Being able to upgrade it down the line
without losing their customizations is "someone else's problem in the future."
(Incidentally, we'd love your help if you're a company that uses Bugzilla and
can let one of your internal developers spend a couple hours per week on
Bugzilla!)</p>

<p>Because Bugzilla is now in this position, we are trying to raise enough
money to directly pay at least one developer, so that it will actually be
someone's job to work on Bugzilla, at least part time. That is our
pie-in-the-sky goal.</p>

<h2>The Legal Stuff</h2>

<p>In mid-2023, a group of the core developers formed <a
href="/about/zarroboogs.html">Zarro Boogs Corporation</a> (ZBC) in order to be
a legal entity which could hold the license to the Bugzilla Trademark and raise
money on behalf of the project. ZBC is a non-charitable non-profit organization
(US Internal Revenue Code §501(c)(4) status), and registered as a
Non-Profit Corporation in the State of Michigan, which means we are required to
spend all money raised on the needs of the project, and not make a profit on
it. However, since we are not a charity, your donations will not be tax
deductible. The Bugzilla trademarks are used under license from the Mozilla
Foundation. ZBC is not affiliated with or owned by the Mozilla Foundation.</p>
