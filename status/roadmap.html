<a name="history"></a>
<h2>Brief History</h2>
<p>When mozilla.org first came online in 1998, one of the first products that
was released was Bugzilla, an open source bug system implemented using freely
available open source tools.  Bugzilla was originally written in
<a href="http://www.tcl.tk/scripting/">TCL</a> by Terry Weissman for use at
mozilla.org to replace the in-house system then in use at Netscape.  Before
mozilla.org released it as open source, Terry decided to port Bugzilla to
<a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a>, with the hopes that more people would be able
to contribute to it, since Perl seemed to be a more popular language.  Bugzilla
2.0 was the result of that port to Perl, and the first version released to the
public via anonymous cvs.  Since then a large number of projects, both
commercial and free have adapted it as their primary method of tracking
software defects.  In April of 2000, Terry handed off control of the Bugzilla
project to Tara Hernandez.  Under Tara's leadership, some of the regular
contributors were coerced into taking more responsibility, and Bugzilla began
to truly become a group effort.  In July of 2001, facing lots of distraction
from her "real job," Tara handed off control to Dave Miller, who is still in
charge as of this writing.</p>

<h2>Where We're Going</h2>

<p>Bugzilla has been installed in enough places that Bugzilla's focus has
changed from being a mozilla.org centered tool to a more generalized bug
tracking system. As such, we need to make installation of Bugzilla easier, have
it support more databases and make it easier to optionally enable and disable
features. It also needs modularity in terms of features and in the UI so that
forking of the code base at individual installations will no longer be a
necessity to fit the local engineering culture.  We also need to allow
customization of other previously hardcoded features, like resolutions and
statuses.</p>

<h2>Re-introduction</h2>

<p>This document then, will serve as the roadmap and outline for Bugzilla
development. It isn't a schedule by any means. It's more an articulation of
where we want to go, the list of things that need to get done, and if you want
to think of it, a long winded plea for help.</p>

<p>Nothing in this document is set in stone. We're open to criticism about
where you think we screwed up and what things you think we left off this list.
Take your ideas and suggestions to the netscape.public.mozilla.webtools
newsgroup on news.mozilla.org to help facilitate discussion.</p>

<h2>Design Principles</h2>

<P>Bugzilla's development should concentrate on being a bug system. While the
potential exists in the code to turn Bugzilla into a technical support ticket
system, task management tool, or project management tool, we should focus on
the task of designing a system to track software defects. While development
occurs, we should stick to the following design principles:</P>

<UL class="spaced">
	<LI>Bugzilla must run on freely available, open source tools. Bugzilla
support should be widened to support commercial databases, tools, and operating
systems, but not at the expense of open source ones.
	<LI>Speed and efficiency should be maintained at all costs. One of
Bugzilla's major attractions is its lightweight implementation and speed.
Minimize calls into the database whenever possible, don't generate speed
sucking HTML, don't fetch more data than you need to, etc, etc.
	<LI>ANSI SQL calls and data types must be used in all new queries and
tables. Avoid database specific calls and datatypes whenever possible.
Existing SQL calls and data types should be converted to ANSI SQL.
	<LI>This should be obvious, but we should be browser agnostic in our
HTML and form generation, which means cleaning up the HTML output of Bugzilla,
and following all applicable standards.
</UL>

<h2>Milestone plans</h2>

<p>The Milestone plans portion of our roadmap is now maintained on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Roadmap">Bugzilla Wiki</a>.</p>
