<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The Bugzilla Team is pleased to announce the release of three versions of Bugzilla today: 2.14.5, 2.16.2, and 2.17.3:
<ul>
<li>2.14.5 is a maintenance release on the 
<a href="#cvs2_14-BRANCH">2.14 branch</a>; it contains a couple of 
security-related bug fixes.
<br><b>Note:</b> this is <b>the last 2.14.x release</b>, as the Bugzilla Team 
has officially stopped supporting the 2.14 branch.
<br><br>
<li>2.16.2 is a maintenance release on the 
<a href="#cvs2_16-BRANCH">2.16 branch</a>, containing a couple of 
security-related bug fixes.
<br>It is recommended that <b>all production installations upgrade</b> to
2.16.2 to make sure they get the fixes for these <a 
href="../security/2.16.1/">security bugs</a>.
<br><br>
<li>2.17.3 is the latest developers' snapshot release from 
<a href="#cvsHEAD">the trunk</a>; it contains the above 
security bug fixes as well as tweaks to 
<A href="2002-11-18.html#newfeatures">features in 2.17.1</a> (bug and 
attachment flags, enterprise groups, etc.). This release is a <b>developers' 
release</b> and is not generally intended for production use.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The security bug fixes on the 2.14.x and 2.16.x branches and the trunk all 
address the same security bugs. These bugs address cross site scripting
vulnerabilities (which the Bugzilla Team <A href="https://groups.google.com/groups?selm=a05200f02ba09808addb5%40%5B192.168.1.203%5D&output=gplain">already released an 
announcement</a> about), and sensitive directory and file permissions. In all
cases, local server compromises aren't possible, but unrestricted Bugzilla 
database access is <i>possible</i>.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, none of these release address 
<a href="2002-11-18.html#win32">the Win32 situation</a> which is still 
unchanged.
</p>

<h2>What Happened to 2.17.2?!</h2>
<p>
Bugzilla project observers may note that we're releasing a 2.17.3 developers' 
release without having released a 2.17.2 version.
</p>
<p>
This was due to an overzealous Bugzilla developer (JayPee) who tagged the 
2.17.2 release in CVS before it was quite ready to be released. Because of
the holiday season and a couple of other bugs that were found, the Team
decided to hold the release of 2.17.2 until <i>after</i> the holidays.
</p>
<p>
But, some astute users noticed the new, incorrect tag and had already started 
to pull it from CVS. Therefore, to minimize confusion, and signify that other 
patches had been checked into the tree after what had been dubbed "2.17.2" was 
tagged, the Team decided to bump the version number to 2.17.3.
</p>
<p>
Developers (and anyone else) do not want the 2.17.2 "release"; they want 
2.17.3.
</p>

<h2>Check-in Policy Update</h2>
<p>
As Bugzilla project lead Dave Miller announced in the last status report, the 
Bugzilla project has changed its policies regarding check-ins. The new policy 
institutes an "approval" process for check-ins and comes as an addition to our
existing review policy.
</p>
<p>
Previously, to check something into Bugzilla's CVS tree, developers were only 
required to get the approval of one or two people on the review team.
That process is now augmented by a requirement of obtaining approval on the 
patch from the project lead or a designee before it can be checked in. 
Current "designees," if there are any, are noted in the 
<a href="../discussion.html">#mozwebtools topic</a>. 
This won't amount to a code review, but rather a 'yes' or 'no' on whether this 
feature or bugfix in this form at this time is the best course of action to 
fulfill Bugzilla's design goals. Approvals are also being used to 
coordinate landing patches, so the approval flag generally won't be set until 
there's a patch ready to land. If you want to know if a patch you're working
on will likely be given approval for check-in before you expend effort on it,
you can ask on the 
<a href="mailto:developers@bugzilla.org">developers@bugzilla.org</a> mailing 
list.
</p>
<p>
Bugzilla developers and reviewers are adjusting to this new policy well, and 
it's seemingly serving the Bugzilla project well. The quick release of another
2.17 developers' snapshot, a mere six weeks after 2.17.1, provides good 
evidence of this.
</p>

<h2>New Bugzilla Features</h2>

<h3>Re-architected Product Groups</h3>
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147275">Bug 147275</a>,
re-architected product groups, has finally landed.  In the 2.17.3 release, the 
entire mechanism for handling groups has been revised.
</p>
<p>
It is now possible to exert much more control over how 
groups and products are related.  In editproducts.cgi, there is now a 
mechanism to permit you to edit the "Group Controls" for a product and 
determine which groups are applicable, default, and mandatory for each 
product as well as controlling entry for each product and being able to 
set bugs in a product to be totally read-only unless some group 
restrictions are met.
</p>
<p>
The patch author, <a href="mailto:bugreport@peshkin.net">Joel Peshkin</a>, has 
noted that all of the possible scenarios have not been anticipated and this is
a new feature, so please Cc him on all bugs you file against re-architected
product groups.  
</p>
<p>
Some examples of advanced uses for the re-architected product groups 
follow:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Example</b>: When several products need to be associated with the same 
default group (formerly a product group), instead of defining several 
groups with the same names as the products and managing memberships in 
each group, a single group can be defined to control access and that 
group can be set as a "Default" group for all of the products.</li>
<li><b>Example</b>:  If certain products are never supposed to have a 
publicly 
accessible bug, define a group of all authorized users and set the 
groups control for those products to indicate that the group is 
Mandatory/Mandatory.  This will place bugs in that group without giving 
the user any option at all.</li>
<li><b>Example</b>: Anyone can enter a security bug.  Create a product for 
security bugs. Do not restrict entry to the product at all. However, set 
the Member/Nonmember permissions to Default/Mandatory for the security group.  
This will permit anyone to enter and members of the security group will be 
able to override the default group restriction while nonmembers will be forced 
to restrict the bug to the security group.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Replication/shadowdb removal</h3>
<p>
The shadowdb was a readonly copy of Bugzilla's database, which Bugzilla 
used for potentially expensive readonly queries, such as from buglist.cgi.
Due to MySQL's table-level locking mechanism, long running queries block
modifications and updates to the database; the shadowdb attempted to alleviate 
this bottleneck by creating a second database for these long running queries
to use.
</p>
<p>
Previously, Bugzilla handled updates from the main database to
the copy on its own by keeping track of every SQL update. These updates
were then sent to the shadow database via a separate process 
(<tt>syncshadowdb</tt>).  This process had several bugs and was inefficient.
</p>
<p>
With the landing of bug 
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124589">124589</a>, which 
added MySQL replication support to Bugzilla, and bug 
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=180870">180870</a>, which 
removed the old manual syncing code, Bugzilla 2.17.3 is now able to use 
the replication facilities provided by the database to handle these updates. 
The system is now given the locations of the two databases, but leaves 
updating them to an alternative process. This simplifies the Bugzilla code, 
and enables further optimizations which were not possible when Bugzilla needed 
to capture all of an SQL UPDATE/INSERT command.
</p>
<h3>New "always-require-login" Parameter</h3>
<p>
This new parameter, added under 
bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173761">173761</a>, 
allows administrators running commercial or sensitive 
Bugzilla installations to require users to present login credentials to
access Bugzilla.
</p>
<p> 
Bugzilla is most commonly used for open source projects, where anyone should
be able to search for and view certain types of bugs. But some entities need to
restrict these operations to logged in users; this parameter allows 
administrators to require a login on every Bugzilla page, except for the
front page. If users try to access any page without login credentials (in the
form of a valid login cookie) and "always-require-login" is set, they will be
prompted for the information before being allowed to continue.
</p>
<h3>Attach and Reassign at Once</h3>
<p>
When developers attach patches or other attachments (testcases, etc.) to bugs,
they will commonly reassign the bug to themselves shortly thereafter, since
that developer is actively working on that bug. These used to be distinct
steps, which generated two email messages and required Bugzilla users to
attach their patch and then reassign the bug to themselves.
</p>
<p>
This patch, added as part of bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116819">116819</a> allows developers to reassign the bug to themselves and set the
status to accepted during the attachment creation process. This effectively
makes the above process one atomic operation, reducing bug spam and 
streamlining a very common process.
