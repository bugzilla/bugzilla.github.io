<h2>Introduction</h2>

This status update covers the 6 months that have gone by since our <a
href="https://www.bugzilla.org/status/2003-04-24.html">last
update</a>. It's been an interesting period in Bugzilla's time, with a
quite a few feature enhancements hitting the trunk and a significant
number of external contributions being submitted.

<p>

To start off, we'd like to congratulate (and nudge ahead) Vlad Dascalu,
Chuck Duvall and Mike Morgan who have been doing excellent work both on
triage and on providing bugfixes. Independent contribution has always been
the mainstay of Bugzilla development, so it's really nice to see people
volunteer the time and expertise that make this a great product. The
lowest bug number fixed was <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13540">bug 13540</a>
-- generalizing previously fixed terms such as "bug" -- which was coaxed
in by Jon Wilmoth. A number of others had first-time patches integrated,
too, and we'd definitely like to see more good work from you all.

<p>

We've got a few security updates that have been covered in the
security advisory simultaneously released. The bugs found and fixed are
not critical -- they are mainly leaks and minor privilege issues -- but
it's always a good idea to update to the latest stable release. The bug
fixes have also been applied to the development branch where relevant.

<p>

A number of interesting features have also been included (in the trunk);
in particular, Gerv integrated a patch that provides <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120030">partial email
spam-proofing</a>, which has always been one of the top requests on
public installations. Gerv also landed an extension to Bugzilla which
allows <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16009">generating
charts</a> from Bugzilla-collected data.  Another notable feature by the
great John Keiser has been included: <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174942">Patch
Viewer</a>, which is an complete (and integrated) diff-viewing tool.
I'm not going to spoil the rest of the surprises, so read the sections
below to find out what other goodies are in this month's grab bag.

<p>

Note that (in tradition with previous updates, which have included a bit
on this subject) Windows support (which implies being able to run a Bugzilla
instance on a Windows web server) is <i>still</i> to be completed and
integrated! We would really appreciate community assistance in fixing
the <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?product=Bugzilla&resolution=---&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&status_whiteboard=Win32">remaining
issues for Windows support</a>.

<p>

We'd also like to remind all Bugzilla administrators that to assist them
in keeping up-to-date with release announcements and security
advisories, we provide an ultra-low-volume administrator mailing list
(announce&#64;bugzilla.org). We advise all Bugzilla administrators to <a
href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-full-long&extra=announce">subscribe</a>
so they can keep up with important Bugzilla news.

<h2>New Releases</h2>

The Bugzilla Team is pleased to announce the 2.16.4 and 2.17.5 releases
of Bugzilla.

<ul>

 <li> The stable (2.16.4) release provides a number of bug fixes,
      including fixes for 4 security issues discovered since the 2.16.3
      release. It is recommended that all production installations
      upgrade to 2.16.4 to make sure they get the fixes for these
      <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/security/2.16.3/">security bugs</a>.
 <p>
 <li> The development (2.17.5) release provides a large number of
      feature enhancements and bug fixes, including fixes for 3 security
      issues discovered since the 2.17.4 release. This release is
      a developers' release and is not intended for production
      use. 
</ul>

We would like to remind all administrators running Bugzilla instances
from the old 2.14 branch that this branch has been retired, and is no
longer being supported actively by the team. We strongly recommend
upgrading to the latest stable version to ensure security and proper
operation.

<h2> New Features (on the Trunk) </h2>

A number of interesting new features are available for testing on our
latest development release. The following items describe the most
important of them, and the manifests towards the end of this document
describe the full list of changes committed.

<ul>

<li><b>Patch Viewer:</b> Viewing and reviewing patches in Bugzilla is
often difficult due to lack of context, improper format and the inherent
readability issues that raw patches present.  Patch Viewer is an
enhancement to Bugzilla designed to fix that by offering increased
context, linking to sections, and integrating with Bonsai, LXR and CVS.
(<a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174942">174942</a>, <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215268">215268</a>)

<p>

<li><b>Term Customization:</b> Formerly, the terms "bug" and "Bugzilla"
were hard-coded into many places in the templates, which made localizing
a Bugzilla instance to an organization's terminology quite difficult.
This change allows this localization to be done in a single template
file; the localized terms are used in all subsequent templates.
(<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13540">13540</a>)

<p>
<li><b>Comment Reply Links:</b> In Edit Bug, each bug comment now
includes a convenient (reply) link that quotes the comment text into the
textarea. This feature is only enabled in Javascript-capable browsers,
but causes no inconvenience to other user agents.
(<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=207754">207754</a>)

<p>
<li><b>Full-Text Search:</b> It is now possible to query the Bugzilla
database using full-text searching, which spans comments and summaries,
and which searches for substrings and stem variations of the search
term.
(<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145588">145588</a>)

<p>
<li><b>Email Address Munging:</b> The fact that raw email addresses are
displayed in Bugzilla makes it trivial for bots that spamharvest to
spider through Bugzilla, in particular, through Bugzilla's buglists.
This change allows obscuring email addresses as they appear in the
Bugzilla web pages.
(<a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120030">120030</a>, <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219216">219216</a>)

<p>

<li><b>Generic Charting:</b> Bugzilla's new charting feature allows you to
display flexible summary charts, based on configurable data sets.
(<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16009">16009</a>)

</ul>

A couple of other features were checked into the trunk, notably
prefilling of the default component owner when entering a new bug, a bug
alias column in the buglist page, and a "view as buglist" link for the sanity
check page.

<p>

<b>A note to users upgrading to version 2.17.5:</b> Bug <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201816">201816</a> changed
header output to use CGI.pm, in a step towards enabling mod_perl compatibility.
This change will affect users that had customized charsets in their CGI
files: previously the charset had to be added everyplace that printed
the Content-Type header;  now it only needs changing in one spot, in
Bugzilla/CGI.pm. Alternatively, Apache's <a
href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html#adddefaultcharset">AddDefaultCharset</a>
directive can be used.

</ul>

<h2> The Road to 2.18 </h2>

<b>An update from Dave Miller, Bugzilla project leader</b>

<p>Bugzilla 2.16 was released on July 29, 2002.  It's been just over 15 months
since then, and we still don't have a Bugzilla 2.18.  What's the deal?  This is
what I get asked quite frequently these days.  I'm hoping to answer that
question here.
</p>
<p>The usual way stable Bugzilla releases get planned is that we decide on a
feature set that we want to have available in the next version, and then
development plugs away until those features are completed.  Shortly after
version 2.16 came out, several of us sat down and hashed out a list of things
that we thought would fit in that list for version 2.18.  In hindsight, the
list that we came up with turned out to be a bit much to handle.  It didn't
look so bad at the time, and in fact I don't think we "overbooked" ourselves,
not if everyone's lives had continued as they had been at that time.
</p>
<p>What ended up happening is that a large percentage of the core contributors
wound up having job changes that eliminated much of the time they used to
spend on Bugzilla.  We went several months with very little development actually
happening.  With the lack of available developers in mind, and a desire to
get 2.18 out the door as soon as we could and still be able to call it "stable"
in good conscience, the list of goals for version 2.18 was revisited, and
significantly pared down.
</p>
<p>We now have 2 remaining goals that have yet to be completed for version
2.18.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Full templatization of the Administrative interfaces (the edit*.cgi
      files)</li>
  <li>Out-of-the-box Win32 compatibility</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the other items that had been on the list (such as support for
PostgreSQL and Sybase, and admin-definable customized fields) will still be
taken if they get completed by then, but will no longer hold up the release if
they aren't completed.
</p>
<p>Things are getting better!  The "dire situation" I painted above seems to be
abating.  As Christian pointed out in his introduction above, we have several
new folks contributing on a regular basis.  Also, my second-in-command, Myk
Melez, is now employed by the Mozilla Foundation as of last month, with
continued development of the entire Mozilla Webtools Suite (which includes
Bugzilla) now being his primary job responsibility.  In short, the future
of Bugzilla once again looks very bright!
</p>

<h2> Upcoming Features </h2>

This section lists major new features that are planned for the next
releases. If you would like to help out -- many of these features need
either planning, coding, or testing -- or just figure what the current

  <li>Wiki integration. (Bug <a

</ul>

Apart from work on Bugzilla itself, Mike Morgan has started work on
redesigning the Bugzilla website to a standards-compliant
version that matches mozilla.org's new look-and-feel. This is already
underway, and we should be seeing a beta site up shortly.

<h2> Trunk Checkins Since the Last Status Update </h2>

The following is a list of specific bugs fixed (and their checkin
messages) since the last Bugzilla status report. It is ordered by the
checkin date as rendered by <a
href="http://bonsai.mozilla.org/">Bonsai</a>.  It includes checkins on
the trunk from 2003/04/25 to 2003/11/02. This list was generated by
filtering Bonsai's output on <a
href="http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsquery.cgi?module=Bugzilla&branch=HEAD&branch_type=match&sortby=Date&date=explicit&mindate=2003-04-25+00:00&maxdate=2003-11-02+11:59&cvsroot=%2Fcvsroot">
that query</a>.
<p>

 Checkins that don't refer to a specific bug number have been omitted,
 and were a significant minority.  Bold italic bugs are
 security-sensitive bugs.

messages) since the last Bugzilla status report. It is ordered by the
checkin date as rendered by <a
href="http://bonsai.mozilla.org/">Bonsai</a>.  It includes checkins on
the branch from 2003/04/25 to 2003/10/30. This list was generated by
filtering Bonsai's output on <a
href="http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsquery.cgi?treeid=default&module=Bugzilla&branch=BUGZILLA-2_16-BRANCH&branchtype=match&dir=&file=&filetype=match&who=&whotype=match&sortby=Date&hours=2&date=explicit&mindate=04%2F25%2F2003+19%3A58&maxdate=10%2F30%2F2003+09%3A45&cvsroot=%2Fcvsroot">that query</a> (with some
manual adjustments).
<p>

Very few checkins were made without reference to any specific bugs,
mainly test bustage fixes and documentation updates.
Bold italic bugs are security-sensitive bugs.

<h2> Conclusion and Credits </h2>

Well, that's it for this status update. We'd like to thank everybody who
submitted a patch, helpful comment or bug to Bugzilla -- it's very much
appreciated, even when everybody's too busy to stop and say "great
work"; we always mean it! Let's work together to make 2.18 the killer
release we all want it to be.

<p>

[Christian: I should also really mention Paul Reed, who (apart from
preparing many of our previous status updates) provided the bug
manifests for this one -- no, actually, I stole them!]
