<h1>Bugzilla Status Update, April 24, 2003</h1>

<center>
  <p><a href="mailto:preed@sigkill.com">J. Paul Reed</a> and the <a href="../developers/profiles.html">Bugzilla Team</a></p>
  <p><b>Thursday, April 24th, 2003</b></p>
<p><a href="./"><b>Previous Updates</b></a></p>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The Bugzilla Team is pleased to announce the release of Bugzilla 2.16.3, 
a maintenance release, and 2.17.4, a new developers' release.
</p>
<p>
2.16.3 continues the Bugzilla Team's support of the stable Bugzilla branch,
fixing a couple of important security vulnerabilities and other bugs for 2.16
Bugzilla users.
</p>
<p>
2.17.4 continues our march toward 2.18, offering new features for developers 
to play with and refine, and new toys for users who like living on the edge,
even though many organizations--mozilla.org included--are using the 2.17 
developers' branch without incident.
</p>
<p>
Users on both branches should upgrade to today's releases. Both contains fixes
for multiple cross-site scripting issues and an insecure temporary filename 
vulnerability. For specifics, see the Bugzilla <a 
href="https://www.bugzilla.org/security/2.16.2/">security advisory</a> on 
these vulnerabilities.
</p>
<p>
2.14.x users may be affected by at least one of these security vulnerabilities 
(<strike><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=197153">bug 197153</a></strike>), 
and are encouraged to upgrade. The Bugzilla Team has 
officially <b>stopped supporting</b> the 2.14 branch. Also, the 2.16/2.17 
branches have lots of cool new goodies on them!
</p>
<p>
If you're wondering about <a href="2002-11-18.html#win32">the Win32
situation</a>, it has improved slightly on the 2.17-branch, but "out of the box"
Win32 support, on either branch, is still, unfortunately, unchanged. 
However, the Bugzilla Team is currently discussing the status of 
"out of box Win32 support" in 2.18 and it is likely to remain a release goal.
</p>

<h2>The Road to 2.18</h2>
<p>
The Bugzilla team has started reviewing goals for the 2.18 release. This 
includes deciding what's important to keep on the list and what might get 
pushed off.
</p>
<p>
As far as timing goes, the Bugzilla Team is not going to set a date; doing
so has bit the project too many times in the past. The answer to "when is 
2.18 coming out?" will continue to be "When it's done."  However, the Team 
understands the need to do it sooner rather than later, so post-release,
we'll be focusing on reducing the list of 2.18 goals. If we can pare this 
down appropriately, 2.17.5 may be the last developer release prior to the
2.18 release candidates. That may or may not be realistic, but it's a
seemingly sensible plan to work from.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="../status/roadmap.html">Bugzilla roadmap</a> 
contains a number of 2.18 goals. If you don't see a feature or fix you feel 
is necessary for 2.18 on that list, now is the time to make your case to the 
module owners. Also, be looking for bugs you're interested in to be 
retargetted in the next few days.  If you're significantly concerned about 
this process, considering joining
the <a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-long-full&extra=developers">Bugzilla developers' mailing list</a>.
</p>
<p>
A good initial summary of the Team's current thinking on goals can be
read in this <a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?list=developers&brief=on&func=archive-get-part&extra=200304/187" target="_blank"><tt>developers@</tt> thread</a>.
</p>

<a name="newfeatures"><h2>New Bugzilla Features</h2></a>

<h3>In-core <tt>processmail</tt></h3>
<strike>
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124174">Bug 124174</a></strike>,
<tt>processmail</tt> as a package, has finally landed. This bug moves bug 
mail handling (mail from bug submissions/changes) from the venerable 
external <tt>processmail</tt> script, the source of much porting pain and 
some security issues, into a new module <tt>Bugzilla::BugMail</tt>.
</p>
<p>This change moves the actual sending of mail into the same Bugzilla core
process handling web requests. This change will make Win32 porting easier 
and has significantly sped up bug mail handling (<strike><a 
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=178153">Bug 178153</a></strike>) for large bug changes. The checkin also cleans up the mail 
sub-system interface and backend, meeting--along with Win32 support--a number
of 2.18 goals.
</p>
<h3>Authentication module/LDAP improvements</h3>
<p>
As part of the ongoing preparation for <tt>mod_perl</tt>, Bugzilla's
authentication mechanisms have been modularized, making pluggable
authentication schemes for Bugzilla a reality. Both the existing database 
and LDAP systems were ported as part of modularization process. 
Additionally, the CGI portion of the backend was redesigned to allow for 
authentication from other sources, including (theoretically) email, 
which will help <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=94850" title="Integrate bug_email into the main code.">Bug 94850</a>.
</p>
<p>
As part of this conversion, LDAP logins now use Perl's standard Net::LDAP
module, which has no external library dependencies. This is a departure 
from using the Mozilla::LDAP modules, which relied on the Netscape LDAP SDK. 
</p>
<h3>Bugzilla <tt>mod_perl</tt> support</h3> 
<p>
Work continues on updating Bugzilla to support <tt>mod_perl</tt>, a 
performance and modularization win.
In addition to the authentication module re-org, patches are pending 
(not included in 2.17.4) to move Bugzilla user handling into a module.
With these and other patches, <tt>show_bug.cgi</tt> (and other minor pages)
now support <tt>mod_perl</tt>, but have not been extensively tested, and are
mostly a proof-of-concept at this point.
</p>
<p>
Initial testing is very encouraging; some very raw performance data suggests 
that for a simple bug with 5 comments, load times decrease from 0.6 seconds 
to 0.15 seconds on an unloaded P4-2.4GHz machine.  
</p>
Despite this, <tt>mod_perl</tt> support is not yet ready for prime time.
Lots of the work is very 'hacked together', and the patches only support 
<tt>mod_perl</tt> installations, to the detriment of normal CGI/Bugzilla
installations. This will, of course, be fixed before checkin.
</p>
<p>
The major factor inhibiting <tt>mod_perl</tt> support is the lack of
development time and the lack of time for other Bugzilla developers to
review patches. If you're interested in helping Bugzilla increase performance
with <tt>mod_perl</tt>, check out  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=mod_perl" title="Make Bugzilla work with mod_perl (under Apache)">bug 87406</a>. 
</p>
<h3>JS versions of buglists</h3> 
<p>
Buglists are now available as JavaScript structures in addition to HTML and
RDF. This allows features like the <a 
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=119087&action=view">
"update buglinks" bookmarklet</a>, which will update the state of all the 
buglinks in a page to have the correct status and tooltip.
</p>
<h3>Perl on the "move" from <tt>/usr/bonsaitools/bin</tt> to <tt>/usr/bin</tt></h3>
<p>
One of the most common support requests was what this "bonsaitools" directory
was all about, and how could the Perl location Bugzilla expects be changed 
from that to the more standard <tt>/usr/bin</tt>.
This request was never fulfilled because Bugzilla's primary installation, 
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a>, needed to have 
Perl installed in a location other than <tt>/usr/bin</tt> and a longstanding 
rule for Bugzilla development has been "don't break mozilla.org." 
</p>
<p>
Because of server changes at mozilla.org, a bonsaitools was no longer 
required for them. After a quick message to the Bugzilla 
<a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/discussion.html">newsgroups 
and mailing lists</a> asking if anybody else relied on this path, it
was determined that finally getting this change checked in wouldn't affect 
many people, so the oft-requested feature was finally completed. 
</p>
<p>
More information can be found in <strike><a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=196433">bug 196433</a></strike>.
</p>
<h3>Doc changes</h3>
<p>
Matthew Barnson, the original author of much of the <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/html/">Bugzilla 
Guide</a>, has recently been swamped by life.  Jacob Steenhagen was gracious
(and foolish) enough to volunteer to take over. In an attempt to "sync up"
the documentation, Jake has been focusing on backporting relevant changes 
to the documentation to the 2.16 branch.  Many items in the guide have 
received love, but the most notable ones include:
<ul>
<li><b>Section 4.3 - OS Specific Installation (New in Devel)</b> - 
  Moved a lot of stuff that is specific to the OS (or distro) out into a
  special section. The next step is to make the installation instructions
  more generic as there are still some OS specific hints, etc.</li>

<li><b>Section 4.4 - HTTP Server Configuration (New in Devel)</b> -
  Moved some information that is specific to the web server being used
  into its own section.  I currently have varying amount of information
  for Apache, IIS, and AOL Server.</li>

<li><b>Section 5.5 - Group Security (Devel)</b> - 
  Because the tip has a new security model the docs needed updating for
  the tip.</li>

<li><b>Section 5.6 - Bugzilla Security (2.16 and Devel)</b> - 
  This section has been cleaned up considerably. It also now contains
  information that used to be scattered about in different sections.</li>

<li><b>Section 5.8 - Upgrading (2.16 and Devel)</b> -
  Add a lot of information about upgrading along with specific
  instructions and examples for 3 different ways to get the latest code.</li>

<li>Many Misc. FAQ Updates (2.16 and Devel)</li>

<li>Finally moved everything to the <tt>xml/</tt> directory.
  For quite some time now, the documentation has been using the DocBook
  4.1.2 XML doctype but still residing in a directory named <tt>sgml/</tt> and
  having file names ending in the .sgml extension. The master documentation
  files now live in the <tt>xml/</tt> directory and have <tt>.xml</tt>
  extensions.</li>
</ul>

Please join the Bugzilla team in welcoming Jake back! Documentation is often
the most overlooked and under-appreciated task of any open source project, so
if you see Jake on IRC, be sure to thank him!
</p>
<h3>Improved localization support</h3>
<p>
With the landing of 
<strike><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=126955">Bug
126955</a></strike>, support for localized Bugzilla templates has improved
tremendously. Bugzilla administrators  can now configure which languages 
are supported by their installations and <i>automatically</i> serve
correct, localized content to users based on the <tt>Accept Language</tt> 
header sent from users' browsers, providing the appropriate language for a
user with minimal configuration on their part.
</p>
<p>
There are currently
<a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/download.html#localizations">localized
templates</a> available for Chinese, German, Spanish (Spain or Mexico) and
Russian. These localized template packs are third-party contributions, 
may only be available for specific versions of 2.16 or 2.17, and may not be
supported in the future.)</p>
</p>
<a name="cvsHEAD"><h2>Trunk Checkins Since the Last Status Update</h2></a>
<p>
The following is a list of specific bugs fixed (and their checkin messages)
since the last Bugzilla status report. It is ordered by the checkin date, as
ordered by <a href="http://bonsai.mozilla.org/">Bonsai</a>. It includes
checkins on the <b>trunk</b> from <b>01/02/2003</b> to <b>04/24/2003</b>. This
list was generated by filtering Bonsai's output on
<a href="http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsquery.cgi?treeid=default&module=Bugzilla&branch=HEAD&branchtype=regexp&sortby=Date&date=explicit&mindate=01%2F02%2F2003+10%3A15%3A00&maxdate=04%2F24%2F2003+23%3A55%3A00&cvsroot=%2Fcvsroot">that query</a>.
