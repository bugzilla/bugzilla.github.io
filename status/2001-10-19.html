<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is the first in a (hopefully) regular series of status updates about
 the progress of Bugzilla development. The aim is to let people know about
 upcoming versions of Bugzilla, so they can better prepare for new features,
 as well as to raise any concerns about them before they leave CVS and become 
a stable tarball.</p>

<h2>The 2.14 Release</h2>

<p>The 2.14 release went relatively smoothly, after some last minute bu ...
 err hitches were encountered on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">
bugzilla.mozilla.org</a>. This site, for those that don't know, was the original
installation of Bugzilla and is the "shakedown" site for the CVS code when
there are no known non-documentation release blockers.</p>
<p>Inevitably release blockers are found when this occurs, and there were
blockers for 2.14 just as there were for 2.12. However, the actual release 
process went relatively smoothly this time around. The process includes 
updating web pages, preparing release announcements/security advisories,
checking in the final documentation, including double checking the release
notes, checking out and preparing a tarball, and so on. Generally this process
occurs over the space of one frantic day.</p>

<h2>2.14+</h2>

<p>The first order of business after 2.14 was to introduce some of the features 
into CVS that were needed on bugzilla.mozilla.org, but weren't considered 
necessary for the 2.14 release because their benefit/risk ratio was not high 
enough. Remembering that bugzilla.mozilla.org is the bug system that is used 
for tracking bugs in Bugzilla (as well as Mozilla), we obviously are acutely 
aware of these issues. These features were checked in and bugzilla.mozilla.org 
updated to CVS. This point was nicknamed "2.14+".</p>
<p>The major part of this was the new "attachment manager". This allows you
 to edit the attributes of attachments. This includes MIME types, is-patch 
 status, the new is-obsolete status, as well as a feature that allows you
 to add your own "attachment statuses" to attachments.&nbsp; These can be 
thought of as to attachments what keywords are to bugs. Examples  include 
"first-review", "needs-work", etc.</p>
<p>The checkin of the attachment manager was followed by a flurry of reporting 
 of minor bugs and desired features to be added.  These include bugs

<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103661" title="Bug 103661 - should be able to do more when attaching files">103661</a> and
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104521" title="Bug 104521 - remove old attachment interface in favor of attachment tracker">104521</a>.
Some of these have been since resolved, while others have not.</p>

<p>This also included a rewrite of the Javascript code that gets run when 
 you add or remove products on the query page. This operation was quite 
slow if you had a reasonable amount of product/components and used a browser
that "reflows" pages, such as Mozilla/N6, IE5+, Konqueror ... (in fact basically 
 everything except N4). The rewrite dramatically improved performance, which 
is now at acceptable levels on bugzilla.mozilla.org.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the new code turned out to regress milestone sortkeys (bug
 <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97736" title="Bug 97736 - New query.cgi javascript doesn't support sortkeys.">97736</a>) and 
selections on pressing the browser back button (bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97966" title="Bug 97966 - Query JS nukes old selections.">
  97966</a>).</p>
<p>The other two patches added a summary to "dependent bug has had its status
 changed" e-mails, as well as fixes to properly shut down a Bugzilla installation
 when the syncshadowdb script is run. bugzilla.mozilla.org used this script
 to do backups.</p>

<h2>Templatisation</h2>

<p>With the introduction of the attachment manager came the start of a process
 that many Bugzilla administrators will surely cheer - templatisation (bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86168" title="Bug 86168 - Bugzilla should use template pages instead of hard-coded HTML">86168</a>).
With  templates, HTML is moved out of the Perl code and into separate files.
 Dynamically  generated data is passed by Bugzilla to the templates and the
result is then displayed.</p>
<p>This makes an administrators job easier, firstly, because they don't need
 to know any Perl to change the user interface, and secondly, because they
 don't need to make changes to their customisted templates every time they
 upgrade.</p>
<p>Previously RedHat's fork of Bugzilla supported this feature using the "Text::Template"
software. However, the attachment manager uses the "Template Toolkit" software
for its templates. This is because the Template Toolkit was judged to be
technically superior.</p>
<p>Although the templates will be different, and administrators of RH Bugzilla 
 would need to convert their templates to use mainline Bugzilla, this and
 other recent events indicate we may see a reunification of RH Bugzilla 
and  mainline Bugzilla at some happy point in the future.</p>
<p>The introduction of the Template Toolkit brought up some issues with the
 software, namely that it failed install tests in certain parts of the world 
(now fixed) and that the CPAN package did not do proper dependency checking.</p>
<p>The introduction also meant that CVS Bugzilla now requires Perl 5.005 or
later, as that is a template toolkit requirement. 2.14 will be the last version
of Bugzilla that allows you to use 5.004.</p>

<p>The landing of the attachment manager brought up various issues with the template implementation, including
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97721" title="Bug 97721 - New min. version for perl [5.005]">97721</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97832" title="Bug 97832 - turn on template pre-compilation">97832</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98658" title="Bug 98658 - Let administrator know which customised templates have been updated by Bugzilla team.">98658</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99024" title="Bug 99024 - checksetup doesn't give template proper permissions.">99024</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99518" title="Bug 99518 - template files do not have license headers">99518</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100089" title="Bug 100089 - Remove old &quot;template&quot; parameters.">100089</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100092" title="Bug 100092 - Template process failed error drops poop trail.">100092</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100094" title="Bug 100094 - General template handling code.">100094</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104261" title="Bug 104261 - attachment.cgi doesn't look in &quot;template/custom&quot; directory">104261</a> and
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104600" title="Bug 104600 - template/custom gets pruned on cvs update -dP">104600</a>.

<p>It is hoped that templatisation may be complete by the end of 2.16.</p>

<h2>Automatically Preventing Problems</h2>

<p>One direction the team is heading is to try and be proactive in preventing
 problems rather than reacting to them.</p>
<p>During the 2.13 cycle <a href="https://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=Bugzilla">
  Tinderboxen were introduced</a> to check that Bugzilla compiled. For those 
not familiar with <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/tinderbox.html">Tinderbox</a>, it is another mozilla.org "web tool" that regularly checks a piece of software 
in CVS for problems.</p>
<p>After 2.14, a new "testing suite" has been included in CVS. Currently this
checks the code for some bad "code patterns" we have encountered in the past.
The testing suite does not do testing in the standard sense - the Bugzilla
code currently does not have adequate separation between "back-end" and "front-end"
(user interface) code to do this easily.</p>
<p>New checks have been suggested that will be added, but more are always 
 welcome. See bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97976" title="Bug 97976 - Tests to do ...">
 97976</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Current tests are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>checking everything compiles, Perl and templates</li>
  <li>checking no tabs are present</li>
  <li>checking only the multi-parameter versions of system and exec are 
 used</li>
  <li>checking all files use -w and use strict</li>
</ul>
<p>The testing suite is now a pre-checkin requirement - all new code must 
 not cause problems it detects. There are currently 3 <a
 href="https://tinderbox.mozilla.org/Bugzilla/">Tinderbox Clients</a> running
 this test suite to catch the naughty people who checkin without running these
 tests.</p>
<p>Another area in which problems can be automatically prevented is by using
 "taint mode". Taint mode is about ensuring data from an untrusted source
(such as the user) must be properly checked before being used to influence
something else (such as the database). Its intention is to make it harder
to introduce security holes into the product where data is not properly checked
or escaped. It is a goal to get all of Bugzilla to use taint mode.</p>
<p>Currently, only "processmail" runs in taint mode.</p>

<h2>Hackers' Guide</h2>

<p>To encourage others to contribute code towards Bugzilla, a "<a href="../developerguide.html">hackers' guide</a>" has been incorporated into the <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/html/">
  Bugzilla Guide</a> that comes with every copy of Bugzilla.</p>
<p>The aim is to quickly explain everything a developer needs to know about 
 contributing code to Bugzilla. This includes both the things we require 
(eg the avoidance of certain features) and prefer (eg style issues).</p>
<p>The document is still in its infancy and it may take some time for all 
 of the conventions and rules of Bugzilla development to be compiled, but
 it should still be useful in its incomplete state. Suggestions are welcome.</p>
<p>As such it is recommended you consult the online version rather than the one shipped with the 2.14 tarball, as it is out of date.</p>
<p><font size="-1"><i>Editor's note: the Hacker's Guide is no longer in the Bugzilla guide, but on the Bugzilla website, renamed as the Developers Guide.  The link above will take you to the new Developers Guide instead.</i></font></p>

<h2>Product Move</h2>

<p>The Bugzilla team felt that having a component in the Webtools product 
on mozilla.org was too limiting and it would be better to move into a Bugzilla 
product. Bugzilla has expanded a lot faster than any of the other mozilla.org 
web tools (such as Bonsai and Tinderbox), both in amount of code and number 
of developers.</p>
<p>While it may have seemed reasonable to have only a Bugzilla component in
the beginning, that no longer is the case. The new product means we can have
different Bugzilla components with different default owners, as well as 10
new votes solely for Bugzilla (as opposed to all the web tools), as it should
be.</p>
<p>Once the product was created the work began moving the open bugs to the
correct component. This has now been completed, and around 800 open bug
reports were moved.</p>
<p>It was decided that the resolved bugs would be all moved to the "Bugzilla-General" 
 component, as there was too many to worry about sorting them into their components.
At the same time, we took to opportunity to piggy back update the assignee
and QA fields on some of the bugs, because emails were already going to be
sent out about these bugs.</p>
<p>Because of this, lack of sleep and the long neglected bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30731" title="Bug 30731 - status not kept in mass reassignment of resolved bugs">
  30731</a> combined to cause an unfortunate incident where 151 resolved
bugs got reopened. This resulted in much grumbling, and a fix checked in.
This caused special problems for bugs marked DUPLICATE, so related bugs <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91808" title="Bug 91808 - Sanity check duplicates table.">
 91808</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97971" title="Bug 97971 - Sanity check should check statuses, resolutions, everconfirmed &amp; number of votes.">
 97971</a> also received attention.</p>

<h2>2.16 Goals</h2>

<p>A message was posted to the webtools mailing list/newsgroup regarding the
<a href="news://news.mozilla.org/3B8D8CA7.2561F657@chariot.net.au">goals for
the 2.16 release</a>. This goes into detail about the two main goals which
are (slightly simplified):</p>
<ul>
  <li>no known bugs</li>
  <li>no pending patches</li>
</ul>
<p>See the message for more details. Other goals that may be dropped include 
fully working on Win32, all files running in taint mode, full templatisation
and fully valid HTML 4.01 output.</p>

<h2>Review Day</h2>

<p>The first "review day" was held on the 5th of October.  The idea of review day was
that developers would not develop but instead help to review some of the patches waiting
for review and check in.<p>

<p>The results were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>9 positive reviews.</li>
  <li>3 negative reviews.</li>
  <li>5 checkins.</li>
  <li>The patch queue size went from approximately 124 to 111.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another review day was held on the 12th of October, but we forgot to keep track
of the stats for it.  However, during that preceding week, the patch queue size
reduced to around 99.  At the time of writing, it was back up.  Hopefully further
review days can result in bouncing the patch queue size off zero.</p>

<h2>Contributions</h2>

<p>There are many ways you can help the Bugzilla team.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Patches to Fix Bugs/Implement New Features.</b> These are very welcome,
       especially if they are targetted for the 2.16 milestone! They need 
to       be appropriately generic for all Bugzilla installations and conform 
to       our other requirements (see the hackers' guide) before they can appear
in       CVS, but if you don't wish to do this, anything is better than nothing,
and       we can use your work as a base.</li>
  <li><b>New documentation.</b> If you think you can help with the documentation for
      Bugzilla, please contact <a href="mailto:barnboy@trilobyte.net">Matthew Barnson</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Testing.</b> Search for bugs in the Bugzilla software, as well as trying
       out pending patches in the bug system.</li>
  <li><b>Review.</b> If you have experience with Perl and Bugzilla code, it would
       be very useful if you look over pending patches in the bug system
and        see if there are any problems with them. As dealing with all pending 
patches        is a 2.16 goal, review and testing of them is especially important. 
Generally        we expect reviewers to have submitted some patches first 
so we can evaluate        their ability. If you fit into this category, please 
contact <a href="mailto:justdave&#64;bugzilla.org">Dave Miller</a> about this.</li>
  <li><b>Automatic Problem Finding.</b> If you have ideas for automatically detecting 
       problems, please let the team know by filing a bug in the <a 
       href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Bugzilla&amp;component=Testing+Suite">Testing
       Suite</a> component.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bugzilla team mainly communicates through the IRC channel #mozwebtools 
 on irc.mozilla.org. All are welcome on this channel, whether you are an
administrator of a Bugzilla installation or wish to contribute. The more
the merrier.</p>
