    any bug report, comment, or patch currently in the Bugzilla system. You
    can play with it here: 
    <a class="ulink" href="http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-4.4-branch/query.cgi" target="_top">http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-4.4-branch/query.cgi</a>.</p><p>The Search page has controls for selecting different possible
    values for all of the fields in a bug, as described above. For some
    fields, multiple values can be selected. In those cases, Bugzilla
    returns bugs where the content of the field matches any one of the selected
    values. If none is selected, then the field can take any value.</p><p>
      After a search is run, you can save it as a Saved Search, which
      will appear in the page footer. If you are in the group defined 
      by the "querysharegroup" parameter, you may share your queries 
      with other users, see <a class="xref" href="userpreferences.html#savedsearches" title="5.10.3. Saved Searches">Saved Searches</a> for more details.

        Highly advanced querying is done using Boolean Charts.
      </p><p>
        The boolean charts further restrict the set of results
        returned by a query. It is possible to search for bugs
        based on elaborate combinations of criteria.
      </p><p>
        The simplest boolean searches have only one term. These searches
        permit the selected left <span class="emphasis"><em>field</em></span>
        to be compared using a
        selectable <span class="emphasis"><em>operator</em></span> to a
        specified <span class="emphasis"><em>value.</em></span>
        Using the "And," "Or," and "Add Another Boolean Chart" buttons, 
        additional terms can be included in the query, further
        altering the list of bugs returned by the query.
      </p><p>
        There are three fields in each row of a boolean search. 
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Field:</em></span>
            the items being searched 
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Operator:</em></span>
            the comparison operator 
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Value:</em></span>
            the value to which the field is being compared
          </p></li></ul></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="pronouns"></a>5.5.1.1. Pronoun Substitution</h4></div></div></div><p>
          Sometimes, a query needs to compare a user-related field
          (such as ReportedBy) with a role-specific user (such as the
          user running the query or the user to whom each bug is assigned).
          When the operator is either "is equal to" or "is not equal to", the value
          can be "%reporter%", "%assignee%", "%qacontact%", or "%user%".
          The user pronoun
          refers to the user who is executing the query or, in the case
          of whining reports, the user who will be the recipient
          of the report. The reporter, assignee, and qacontact
          pronouns refer to the corresponding fields in the bug.
        </p><p>
          Boolean charts also let you type a group name in any user-related
          field if the operator is either "is equal to", "is not equal to" or
          "contains the string (exact case)". This will let you query for
          any member belonging (or not) to the specified group. The group name
          must be entered following the "%group.foo%" syntax, where "foo" is
          the group name. So if you are looking for bugs reported by any user
          being in the "editbugs" group, then you can type "%group.editbugs%".
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="negation"></a>5.5.1.2. Negation</h4></div></div></div><p>
          At first glance, negation seems redundant. Rather than
          searching for
          </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
              NOT("summary" "contains the string" "foo"),
            </p></blockquote></div><p>
          one could search for 
          </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
              ("summary" "does not contain the string" "foo").
            </p></blockquote></div><p>
          However, the search 
          </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
              ("CC" "does not contain the string" "@mozilla.org")
            </p></blockquote></div><p>
          would find every bug where anyone on the CC list did not contain 
          "@mozilla.org" while
          </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
              NOT("CC" "contains the string" "@mozilla.org")
            </p></blockquote></div><p>
          would find every bug where there was nobody on the CC list who
          did contain the string. Similarly, the use of negation also permits
          complex expressions to be built using terms OR'd together and then
          negated. Negation permits queries such as
          </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
              NOT(("product" "is equal to" "update") OR 
            ("component" "is equal to" "Documentation"))
            </p></blockquote></div><p>
          to find bugs that are neither 
          in the update product or in the documentation component or
          </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
              NOT(("commenter" "is equal to" "%assignee%") OR 
              ("component" "is equal to" "Documentation"))
            </p></blockquote></div><p>
          to find non-documentation
          bugs on which the assignee has never commented.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="multiplecharts"></a>5.5.1.3. Multiple Charts</h4></div></div></div><p>
          The terms within a single row of a boolean chart are all
          constraints on a single piece of data. If you are looking for
          a bug that has two different people cc'd on it, then you need 
          to use two boolean charts. A search for
          </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
              ("cc" "contains the string" "foo@") AND
              ("cc" "contains the string" "@mozilla.org")
            </p></blockquote></div><p>
          would return only bugs with "foo@mozilla.org" on the cc list.
          If you wanted bugs where there is someone on the cc list
          containing "foo@" and someone else containing "@mozilla.org",
          then you would need two boolean charts.
          </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
              First chart: ("cc" "contains the string" "foo@")
            </p><p>
              Second chart: ("cc" "contains the string" "@mozilla.org")
            </p></blockquote></div><p>
          The bugs listed will be only the bugs where ALL the charts are true.
        </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="quicksearch"></a>5.5.2. Quicksearch</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Quicksearch is a single-text-box query tool which uses
        metacharacters to indicate what is to be searched. For example, typing
        "<code class="literal">foo|bar</code>"
        into Quicksearch would search for "foo" or "bar" in the
        summary and status whiteboard of a bug; adding
        "<code class="literal">:BazProduct</code>" would
        search only in that product.
        You can use it to find a bug by its number or its alias, too.
      </p><p>
        You'll find the Quicksearch box in Bugzilla's footer area.
        On Bugzilla's front page, there is an additional
        <a class="ulink" href="../../page.cgi?id=quicksearch.html" target="_top">Help</a>
        link which details how to use it.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="casesensitivity"></a>5.5.3. Case Sensitivity in Searches</h3></div></div></div><p>
      Bugzilla queries are case-insensitive and accent-insensitive, when
      used with either MySQL or Oracle databases. When using Bugzilla with
      PostgreSQL, however, some queries are case-sensitive. This is due to
      the way PostgreSQL handles case and accent sensitivity. 
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="list"></a>5.5.4. Bug Lists</h3></div></div></div><p>If you run a search, a list of matching bugs will be returned.
      </p><p>The format of the list is configurable. For example, it can be
      sorted by clicking the column headings. Other useful features can be
      accessed using the links at the bottom of the list:
        </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Long Format:</span></dt><dd><p>
                this gives you a large page with a non-editable summary of the fields

                save the list as a live bookmark by clicking the live bookmark
                icon in the status bar.  To limit the number of bugs in the feed,
                add a limit=n parameter to the URL.

        You can add and remove tags from individual bugs, which let you find and
        manage bugs more easily. Tags are per-user and so are only visible and editable
        by the user who created them. You can then run queries using tags as a criteria,
        either by using the Advanced Search form, or simply by typing "tag:my_tag_name"
        in the QuickSearch box at the top (or bottom) of the page. Tags can also be
        displayed in buglists.
      </p><p>
        This feature is useful when you want to keep track of several bugs, but
        for different reasons. Instead of adding yourself to the CC list of all
        these bugs and mixing all these reasons, you can now store these bugs in
        separate lists, e.g. <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Keep in mind</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Interesting bugs</span>”</span>,
        or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Triage</span>”</span>. One big advantage of this way to manage bugs
        is that you can easily add or remove tags from bugs one by one.
