      You should use attachments, rather than comments, for large chunks of ASCII
      data, such as trace, debugging output files, or log files. That way, it
      doesn't bloat the bug for everyone who wants to read it, and cause people to
      receive fat, useless mails.
    </p><p>You should make sure to trim screenshots. There's no need to show the
      whole screen if you are pointing out a single-pixel problem.
    </p><p>Bugzilla stores and uses a Content-Type for each attachment
      (e.g. text/html). To download an attachment as a different
      Content-Type (e.g. application/xhtml+xml), you can override this
      using a 'content_type' parameter on the URL, e.g.
      <code class="filename">&amp;content_type=text/plain</code>.
    </p><p>
      Also, you can enter the URL pointing to the attachment instead of
      uploading the attachment itself. For example, this is useful if you want to
      point to an external application, a website or a very large file. Note that
      there is no guarantee that the source file will always be available, nor
      that its content will remain unchanged.
    </p><p>
      Another way to attach data is to paste text directly in the text field,
      and Bugzilla will convert it into an attachment. This is pretty useful
      when you do copy and paste, and you don't want to put the text in a temporary
      file first.

      lack of context, improper format and the inherent readability issues that
      raw patches present.  Patch Viewer is an enhancement to Bugzilla designed
      to fix that by offering increased context, linking to sections, and
      integrating with Bonsai, LXR and CVS.</p><p>Patch viewer allows you to:</p><table border="0" summary="Simple list" class="simplelist"><tr><td>View patches in color, with side-by-side view rather than trying
        to interpret the contents of the patch.</td></tr><tr><td>See the difference between two patches.</td></tr><tr><td>Get more context in a patch.</td></tr><tr><td>Collapse and expand sections of a patch for easy
        reading.</td></tr><tr><td>Link to a particular section of a patch for discussion or
        review</td></tr><tr><td>Go to Bonsai or LXR to see more context, blame, and
        cross-references for the part of the patch you are looking at</td></tr><tr><td>Create a rawtext unified format diff out of any patch, no
        matter what format it came from</td></tr></table><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="patchviewer_view"></a>5.7.1.1. Viewing Patches in Patch Viewer</h4></div></div></div><p>The main way to view a patch in patch viewer is to click on the
        "Diff" link next to a patch in the Attachments list on a bug. You may
        also do this within the edit window by clicking the "View Attachment As
        Diff" button in the Edit Attachment screen.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="patchviewer_diff"></a>5.7.1.2. Seeing the Difference Between Two Patches</h4></div></div></div><p>To see the difference between two patches, you must first view the
        newer patch in Patch Viewer.  Then select the older patch from the
        dropdown at the top of the page ("Differences between [dropdown] and
        this patch") and click the "Diff" button. This will show you what
        is new or changed in the newer patch.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="patchviewer_context"></a>5.7.1.3. Getting More Context in a Patch</h4></div></div></div><p>To get more context in a patch, you put a number in the textbox at
        the top of Patch Viewer ("Patch / File / [textbox]") and hit enter.
        This will give you that many lines of context before and after each
        change. Alternatively, you can click on the "File" link there and it
        will show each change in the full context of the file. This feature only
        works against files that were diffed using "cvs diff".</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="patchviewer_collapse"></a>5.7.1.4. Collapsing and Expanding Sections of a Patch</h4></div></div></div><p>To view only a certain set of files in a patch (for example, if a
        patch is absolutely huge and you want to only review part of it at a
        time), you can click the "(+)" and "(-)" links next to each file (to
        expand it or collapse it). If you want to collapse all files or expand
        all files, you can click the "Collapse All" and "Expand All" links at the
        top of the page.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="patchviewer_link"></a>5.7.1.5. Linking to a Section of a Patch</h4></div></div></div><p>To link to a section of a patch (for example, if you want to be
        able to give someone a URL to show them which part you are talking
        about) you simply click the "Link Here" link on the section header. The
        resulting URL can be copied and used in discussion.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="patchviewer_bonsai_lxr"></a>5.7.1.6. Going to Bonsai and LXR</h4></div></div></div><p>To go to Bonsai to get blame for the lines you are interested in,
        you can click the "Lines XX-YY" link on the section header you are
        interested in. This works even if the patch is against an old
        version of the file, since Bonsai stores all versions of the file.</p><p>To go to LXR, you click on the filename on the file header
        (unfortunately, since LXR only does the most recent version, line
        numbers are likely to rot).</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="patchviewer_unified_diff"></a>5.7.1.7. Creating a Unified Diff</h4></div></div></div><p>If the patch is not in a format that you like, you can turn it
        into a unified diff format by clicking the "Raw Unified" link at the top
        of the page.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="bugreports.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="using.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="hintsandtips.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">5.6. Filing Bugs </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 5.8. Hints and Tips</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
