>LDAP authentication is a module for Bugzilla's plugin

          </P
><P
>&#13;          The existing authentication
          scheme for Bugzilla uses email addresses as the primary user ID, and a
          password to authenticate that user. All places within Bugzilla that
          require a user ID (e.g assigning a bug) use the email
          address. The LDAP authentication builds on top of this scheme, rather
          than replacing it. The initial log-in is done with a username and
          password for the LDAP directory. Bugzilla tries to bind to LDAP using
          those credentials and, if successful, tries to map this account to a
          Bugzilla account. If an LDAP mail attribute is defined, the value of this
          attribute is used, otherwise the "emailsuffix" parameter is appended to LDAP
          username to form a full email address. If an account for this address
          already exists in the Bugzilla installation, it will log in to that account.
          If no account for that email address exists, one is created at the time
          of login. (In this case, Bugzilla will attempt to use the "displayName"
          or "cn" attribute to determine the user's full name.) After
          authentication, all other user-related tasks are still handled by email
          address, not LDAP username. For example, bugs are still assigned by
          email address and users are still queried by email address.
