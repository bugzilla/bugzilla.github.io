>&#13;      The release of Bugzilla 3.0 added the ability to create Custom Fields. 
      Custom Fields are treated like any other field - they can be set in bugs
      and used for search queries. Administrators should keep in mind that
      adding too many fields can make the user interface more complicated and
      harder to use. Custom Fields should be added only when necessary and with 
      careful consideration.

>&#13;        Before adding a Custom Field, make sure that Bugzilla can not already
        do the desired behavior. Many Bugzilla options are not enabled by 
        default, and many times Administrators find that simply enabling
        certain options that already exist is sufficient.

              Integer that determines in which order Custom Fields are

              Boolean that determines whether this field can be set on
              bug creation. If not selected, then a bug must be created 
              before this field can be set. See <A

              Boolean that determines whether the value set on this field
              should appear in bugmail when the bug is filed. This attribute
              has no effect if the field cannot be set on bug creation.
            </P

              Boolean that determines whether this field should

            </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;              <EM
>Is mandatory:</EM
>
              Boolean that determines whether this field must be set.
              For single and multi-select fields, this means that a (non-default)
              value must be selected, and for text and date fields, some text
              must be entered.
            </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;              <EM
>Field only appears when:</EM
>
              A custom field can be made visible when some criteria is met.
              For instance, when the bug belongs to one or more products,
              or when the bug is of some given severity. If left empty, then
              the custom field will always be visible, in all bugs.
            </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;              <EM
>Field that controls the values that appear in this field:</EM
>
              When the custom field is of type <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Drop Down"</SPAN
> or
              <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Multiple-Selection Box"</SPAN
>, you can restrict the
              availability of the values of the custom field based on the
              value of another field. This criteria is independent of the
              criteria used in the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Field only appears when"</SPAN
>
              setting. For instance, you may decide that some given value
              <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"valueY"</SPAN
> is only available when the bug status
              is RESOLVED while the value <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"valueX"</SPAN
> should
              always be listed.
              Once you have selected the field which should control the
              availability of the values of this custom field, you can
              edit values of this custom field to set the criteria, see
              <A

        have been used, can be deleted completely (else the integrity
        of the bug history would be compromised). For custom fields marked
        as obsolete, a "Delete" link will appear in the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Action"</SPAN
>
        column. If the custom field has been used in the past, the deletion
        will be rejected. But marking the field as obsolete is sufficient
        to hide it from the user interface entirely.
