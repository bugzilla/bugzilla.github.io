>&#13;          If you have modified the code or templates of your Bugzilla,

          degree and methods of local customization can be found in

          is going to be to upgrade if you have made local customizations.
          Upgrading from 3.0 to 3.0.1 should be fairly painless even if
          you are heavily customized, but going from 2.18 to 3.0 is going
          to mean a fair bit of work re-writing your local changes to use
          the new files, logic, templates, etc. If you have done no local
          changes at all, however, then upgrading should be approximately
          the same amount of work regardless of how long it has been since
          your version was released.

></H2
><P
>&#13;        Bugzilla 3.0 introduced the ability to automatically notify
        administrators when new releases are available, based on the
        <TT
CLASS="literal"
>upgrade_notification</TT
> parameter, see
        <A
HREF="parameters.html"
>Section 3.1</A
>. Administrators will see these
        notifications when they access the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>index.cgi</TT
>
        page, i.e. generally when logging in. Bugzilla will check once per
        day for new releases, unless the parameter is set to
        <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"disabled"</SPAN
>. If you are behind a proxy, you may have to set
        the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>proxy_url</TT
> parameter accordingly. If the proxy
        requires authentication, use the
        <TT
CLASS="literal"
>http://user:pass@proxy_url/</TT
> syntax.
