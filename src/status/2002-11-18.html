<h2>State of Bugzilla</h2>

<p>
We have come to an exciting time in the life of the Bugzilla project.  In the
last few months, we've had a few major companies adopt Bugzilla for their
internal bug-tracking systems.  OK, nothing new here; <i>lots</i> of companies
use Bugzilla.  
</p>
<p>
So what's the big deal?  These particular companies are contributing back.
We've gotten a number of <b>major</b> features in the last couple months, and
some other major features in the works, all contributed by companies who are
paying their employees to make Bugzilla meet their needs.
</p>
<p>
This is a really good thing for Bugzilla, because it means we're gaining more
features that will appeal to the enterprise market rather than just small
companies and Open Source groups. It also puts enterprise-level features into
the hands of the small companies and Open Source groups.  And those same
enterprise-level corporations are the ones who can afford to put full-time
manpower on improving the product, which just repeats the cycle.  I think of it
as a "coming of age" for Bugzilla, and a really good demonstration of the power
of Open Source.
</p>
<p>
But this isn't all flowery and sweet-smelling. With that type of contribution
level also comes a great challenge.  Not everyone who wants to use Bugzilla is
going to want all of these features.  Sure, a lot of them are really cool--you
can read about some of them below--but each software development environment is
different, and not everyone will have a use for every feature.  So the Bugzilla
team is now presented with the challenge of making sure Bugzilla remains easily
configurable and scalable from the very small to the very large. There's also
the challenge of making sure new features don't slow Bugzilla down beyond a
reasonable level, as we've already run into in some cases with the changes to
products, components, and groups.
</p>
<p>
There's also the sense of "too many cooks in the kitchen" that has to be
addressed.  We <b>love</b> getting all this help but to ensure that Bugzilla's
goals continue to get met, I feel it's necessary to institute an "approval"
process for checkins. This new policy comes as an addition to our existing
review policy.
</p>
<p>
Previously, the only thing developers had to do to check something into
Bugzilla's CVS tree was get one or two people on the review team to say "yes,
this is quality code" and they could check it in.  That process isn't going
away, but in addition to that, approval will now need to be obtained from
myself or a designee before it can be checked in.  This won't amount to a code
review, rather a 'yes' or 'no' to whether this feature or bugfix in this form
at this time is the best course of action to fulfill Bugzilla's design goals.
</p>
<p>
Our core development team has always been very good about ensuring that their
individual work is peer reviewed for quality, and their checkin coordinated
with other work going on in the tree to ensure the greatest benefit for
Bugzilla, both from a code/feature perspective and a software
engineering/management perspective.  This new policy simply ensures that all
our "master chefs" in the "kitchen" are working on the same course, preparing
the same style of food, ensuring that we continue to provide the best damn
bug-tracking package available today <i>and</i> tomorrow, for open source
project and enterprise customer alike.

<h2>Since the Last Status Report...</h2>
<p>
The Bugzilla Team has been working furiously over the past two weeks on
readying the trunk for a 2.17.1 development release.  I know many of you
reading this were hoping to see that tarball of 2.17.1 by now, but there were
some
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=bmo-regressions">regressions</a>
found during the recent <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">mozilla.org</a>
upgrade to 2.17.1 from cvs, which we decided were glaring enough that we really
should fix them first before we rolled the tarball.
</p>

<p>
2.17.1 is slated to be released within the week; the Bugzilla team is currently
stamping out the last few of the above-mentioned regressions which have cropped
up. 2.17.1 is intended for developers wishing to base large landings or patches
off an official bugzilla.org release. It should not be used for production
purposes, except in special circumstances.  2.17.1 is not a solution for Win32
users (<a href="#win32">see below</a>).  The vast majority of sites wanting to
test or use Bugzilla in production should install
<a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/releases/2.16.1/">2.16.1</a>.  If you're not
sure whether you should use 2.17.1 or 2.16.1, you want 2.16.1.
</p>

<h2>Administrators' Mailing List Reminder</h2>

<p>
We'd like to remind all Bugzilla administrators that to assist them in keeping
up-to-date with release announcements and security advisories, we've started a
mailing list for people who administer Bugzillas. It is very low traffic -
release announcements and security advisories only. We advise all Bugzilla
administrators to 
<a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-full-long&extra=announce">subscribe</a>,
so they can keep up with important Bugzilla news.
</p>

<a name="win32"></a>
<h2>The (Unchanged) Win32 Situation</h2>

<p>
Bugzilla-on-Win32 is still unchanged: administrators using Win32 as their
platform for Bugzilla do not want the 2.16 branch, including 2.16.1, nor do
they want 2.17.1.  The plan is to make the trunk Win32-friendly (which involves
a number of quite large changes, and which <i>unfortunately</i> did not happen
in this release cycle) and then announce that fact, allowing Win32 Bugzilla
administrators to pull from the trunk on a known tag. This may become a 2.17.2
release. Interested admins can search bugzilla on the 
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&product=Bugzilla&long_desc_type=allwordssubstr&long_desc=&bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_file_loc=&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&status_whiteboard=%5Bneeded+for+Win32bz%5D&keywords_type=allwords&keywords=&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_status=RESOLVED&emailassigned_to1=1&emailtype1=substring&email1=&emailassigned_to2=1&emailreporter2=1&emailqa_contact2=1&emailtype2=substring&email2=&bugidtype=include&bug_id=&votes=&changedin=&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&cmdtype=doit&newqueryname=&order=Reuse+same+sort+as+last+time&field0-0-0=noop&type0-0-0=noop&value0-0-0=">[needed for Win32bz]</a>
status whiteboard entry to track bugs that are part of this process.
</p>

<p>
The Bugzilla Team continues to recommend Unix-based operating systems,
including Linux, as the best platform for a Bugzilla installation; please
consider it if you are starting a new Bugzilla installation and have some say
in the platform decision. Trust us: it makes life easier for everyone.
</p>

<h2>New Bugzilla Features</h2>

<h3>Reporting Improvements</h3>
<p>
Bugzilla has a new mechanism for generating reports of the current state of the
bug database. It has two, related parts: a table-based view, and several
graphical views.
</p>
<p>
The table-based view allows you to specify an x, y and z (multiple tables of
data) axis to plot, and then restrict the bugs plotted using the standard query
form. You can take the data as HTML or CSV, for importing into a spreadsheet.
Each number in the HTML version of the table is linked to a query which
produces the list.
</p>
<p>
So, for example, a Netscape manager could plot assignee vertically, and
severity horizontally, and restrict assignee to the names of his managees. He
would then be able to see which of his managees was overloaded with severe
bugs.
</p>
<p>
There are also bar, line and pie charts, which are defined in a very similar
way. These views may be more appropriate for particular data types, and are
suitable for saving and then putting into presentations or web pages.
</p>
<p>
Note that no attempt is made to prevent you from plotting silly data sets. For
example, if you plot a graph of "assignee" along the X axis, and choose a line
graph, your line won't mean very much.
</p>
<p>

Example: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/report.cgi?x_axis_field=bug_status&y_axis_field=component&product=MailNews&cumulate=1&format=table&ctype=html&action=wrap">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/report.cgi?x_axis_field=bug_status&y_axis_field=component
&product=MailNews&cumulate=1&format=table&ctype=html&action=wrap</a>
(You can switch between report types using the controls at the bottom.)



<h3>Request Tracker</h3>
<p>
The Request Tracker (RT) is a set of enhancements that make attachment statuses
more powerful and easier to administer. It includes the following changes:
<ul>
<li>Additional states: Previously attachment statuses could be in one of two
states: off or on.  RT adds two more states for a total of four: off, 
granted, denied, and (optionally) requested, where "granted" is the equivalent 
of "on".  These additions mean it is no longer necessary to define a status 
to negate another status (f.e. "needs-work" to negate "has-review") because
negation is built into each status via the status' "denied" state.
<li>Bug statuses: Previously only attachments could have these kinds of
statuses.  RT enables them for bugs as well.  Since the word "status" already
has a meaning for bugs, attachment statuses have been renamed to "flags" to
avoid confusion.
<li>Requests: Flags can now optionally be made requestable, which means users
can ask other users to set them.  When a user requests a flag, Bugzilla 
emails the requestee and adds the request to a browsable queue so both the 
requester and the requestee can keep track of its status.  Once the requestee 
fulfills the request by setting the flag to either granted or denied, 
Bugzilla emails the requestee and removes the request from the queue.
<br>
This feature supports workflow like the mozilla.org code review and milestone 
approval processes, whereby code is peer reviewed before being committed and 
patches get approved by product release managers for inclusion in specific 
product releases.
<li>Product/component specificity: Previously flags were product-specific, and
if you wanted the same flag for multiple products you had to define multiple
flags with the same name.  Flags are now product/component-specific, and a
single flag can be enabled or disabled for multiple product/component
combinations via inclusions and exclusions lists.  Flags are enabled for all
combinations on their inclusions list except those that appear on their
exclusions list.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
For more information see the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/flag-help.html">brief online documentation</a>.
</p>

<h3>User Wildcard Matching</h3>
<p>
Sites can now enable the use of wildcards and substrings in bug entry and
editing forms. If the <tt>usermatchmode</tt> param is set to wildcard, then any
"*" included in email addreses will be treated as a wildcard and cause the
entry provided to be matched against all active userids and real names in the
system.  If <tt>usermatchmode</tt> is set to search, addresses that do not
exactly match an existing email address will be matched as a substring as well.
</p>
<p>
Two other paramaters influence the behavior of wildcards,
<tt>maxusermatches</tt> and <tt>confirmuniqueusermatch</tt> permit a site to
determine how broadly to apply ambiguous wildcards and to determine if all
wildcard expansions should be confirmed.
</p>

<h3>Support for "Insiders"</h3>
<p>
If the <tt>insidergroup</tt> parameter is defined, a specific group of users
can be designated insiders who can designate comments and attachments as
private to other insiders.  These comments and attachments will be invisible to
other users who are not members of the insiders group even if the bugs to which
they apply are visible.  Other insiders will see the comments and attachments
with a visual tinting indicating that they are private.
</p>

<h3>Enterprise Group Support</h3>
<p>
The 55 group limit is now gone along with the <code>groupset</code> and
<code>blessgroupset</code> bitset fields.  Each user is now a member of a list
of groups.  It is now possible to define a group in terms of other groups as
well as to place individual users in a group directly.
</p>
<p>
Bugzilla now keeps track of whether a user was added to a group via a regular
expression match or whether they were explicitly added to that group.  Changes
to regular expressions for group membership now take effect instantly for all
users when updated, and no longer apply only to new accounts.  If a member no
longer matches the group's regexp, and they were originally added to that group
because they matched the regexp, they are removed from that group.  Note that
the upgrade process has no way to know who was added to a group explicitly and
who was added by a regexp, so all members of a group prior to this feature will
remain members of that group until explicitly removed from it via the user
editor, wether they still match the regexp or not.
</p>

<h3>Estimated/Actual/Remaining Time</h3>
<p>
If the <tt>timetrackinggroup</tt> parameter is defined, members of the named
group get controls for tracking the time spent fixing a bug added to the bug
form.  Any time comments are added to the bug, members of the time tracking
group can add an amount of time they spent, and it's figured into the total
and displayed at the top of the bug.  Shown in the bug are your original
estimate, the amount of time spent so far, the revised estimate of how much
time is remaining, and your gain/loss on the original estimate.
</p>

<h3>Support for database replication</h3>
<p>
The shadow database is a read-only copy of the Bugzilla database which can be
used for queries. Until now, keeping the main database in sync with the shadow
was handled internally by Bugzilla. This has several issues with performance,
stability, and accuracy, and so Bugzilla now supports using MySQL's replication
to handle the mirroring
(<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124589">bug 124589</a>).
</p>
<p>
As announced before the release of Bugzilla 2.16, the only supported way for a
read-only database will soon become replication
(<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=180870">bug 180870</a>).
It is not expected that this will cause any problems for sites, as the only
installation known to be using the shadowdb is bugzilla.mozilla.org. The old
code will be removed from Bugzilla as soon as <span title="bugzilla.mozilla.org">bmo</span>
upgrades, and well before the next stable release (2.18).
</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Improvements</h3>
<p>
2.17.1 also introduces a number of general improvements; these features are now
available on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">bmo</a>.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=linkify.html">Autolinkification
Page</a> - It's now possible to apply Bugzilla's comment hyperlinking algorithm
to any text you like. This should be useful for status updates and other web
pages which give lists of bugs. The bug links created include the subject,
status and resolution of the bug as a tooltip. 
<li>There are more &lt;link&gt; tags on the links toolbar for navigating
quickly between different areas
<li>Buglists are now available as comma-separated value files (CSV) (link at
the bottom)
<li>Keywords and dependencies can now be entered during initial bug entry
<li>The performance of some queries and CGIs has been improved; unfortunately,
some have also gotten worse; "hey, that's life."
</ul>
</p>
