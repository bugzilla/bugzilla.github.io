<h2>For Users</h2>

<a name="searchpage"></a>
<h3>Advanced Search Capabilities</h3>
<p>Bugzilla offers two forms of search:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A basic Google-like bug search that is simple for new users and searches
    the full text of a bug.</li>
  <li>A very advanced search system where you can create any search you want,
    including time-based searches (such as "show me bugs where the priority
    has changed in the last 3 days") and other very-specific queries.</li>
</ul>

<a name="email"></a>
<h3>Email Notifications Controlled By User Preferences</h3>
<p>You can get an email about any change made in Bugzilla, and which
  notifications you get on which bugs is fully controlled by your
  personal user preferences.</p>

<a name="buglist-formats"></a>
<h3>Bug Lists in Multiple Formats (Atom, iCal, etc.)</h3>
<p>When you search for bugs, you can get the results in many different
  formats than just the basic HTML layout. Bug lists are available
  in Atom, if you want to subscribe to a search like it was a feed.
  They're also available in iCalendar format, so if you're using the
  time-tracking features of Bugzilla you can see where your bugs fit
  into your calendar!</p>

<p>There are even more formats available, such as a long, printable
  report format that contains all the details of every bug, a CSV
  format for importing into spreadsheets, and various XML formats.</p>

<a name="whining"></a>
<h3>Scheduled Reports (Daily, Weekly, Hourly, etc.) by Email</h3>
<p>Bugzilla has a system that will send you, another user, or a group
  that you specify the results of a particular search on a schedule that
  you specify! It can be at any time of day, and it can happen as often
  as every fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Access to this system is controlled by Bugzilla's groups system, so
  you can limit who has access to it, and separately, who is able to
  send reports to users other than themselves.</p>

<a name="reporting"></a>
<h3>Reports and Charts</h3>
<p>Bugzilla has a very advanced reporting systems. If you want to know how
  your bug database looks right now, you can create a table using any
  two fields as the X and Y axis, and using any search criteria to limit
  the bugs you want information on.</p>

<p>For example, you could pick Product
  as the X axis, and Status as the Y axis, and then you would see
  <a href="https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/report.cgi?x_axis_field=product&y_axis_field=bug_status&z_axis_field=&query_format=report-table&format=table&action=wrap">a report
  of how many bugs were in each Status, in each Product</a>.</p>

<p>You can also view that same table as a <a href="https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/report.cgi?x_axis_field=product&y_axis_field=bug_status&z_axis_field=&width=600&height=350&action=wrap&format=line">line graph</a>,
  <a href="https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/report.cgi?x_axis_field=product&y_axis_field=bug_status&z_axis_field=&width=600&height=350&action=wrap&format=bar">bar graph</a>,
  or <a href="https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/report.cgi?z_axis_field=product&format=pie&x_axis_field=bug_status&query_format=report-graph&action=wrap">pie chart</a>.</p>

<p>You can also specify a "Z axis" to generate multiple tables or graphs.</p>

<p>You can even export these reports as CSV so that you can work with them
  in a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Finally, to see how your Bugzilla installation has changed over time,
  Bugzilla also supports a charting system, which can create
  <a href="https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/reports.cgi?product=FoodReplicator&datasets=NEW&datasets=RESOLVED">graphs that
  track changes in the system over time</a>.</p>

<h3 id="autodup">Automatic Duplicate Bug Detection</h3>

<p>When filing a bug in Bugzilla, as soon as you start typing a short
  summary for it, Bugzilla will automatically look for similar
  bugs in the system and allow the user to add themselves to the
  CC list of one of those bugs instead of filing a new one.</p>

<a name="email-in"></a>
<h3>File/Modify Bugs By Email</h3>
<p>In addition to the web interface, you can send Bugzilla an email
  that will create a new bug, or will modify an existing bug. You can
  also very easily attach files to bugs this way.</p>

<a name="time-tracking"></a>
<h3>Time Tracking</h3>
<p>You can estimate how many hours a bug will take to fix, and then
  keep track of the hours you spend working on it. You can also
  set a deadline that a bug must be complete by.</p>

<p>For installations that don't need time-tracking, you can turn off
  these fields. You can also control who is able to see them.
  (Just modify the <kbd>timetrackinggroup</kbd> parameter!)</p>

<a name="rs"></a>
<h3>Request System</h3>
<p>The Request System is a method of asking other users to do something
  with a particular bug or attachment. That other user can then grant
  (say "yes" to) your request, or deny (say "no" to) your request, and
  Bugzilla keeps track of their answer. You can use it for various
  purposes; whether you need to ask for code review, request information from
  a specific user, or get a sign-off from a manager, the system is
  extremely flexible and can do what you need.</p>

<a name="private"></a>
<h3>Private Attachments and Comments</h3>
<p>If you are in the "insider group," you can mark certain attachments and
  comments as private, and then they will be invisible to users who are
  not in the insider group.</p>

<p>Users will know that a comment was hidden (because the comment numbering
  will look something like "1, 2, 3, 5" to them), but they will not be able
  to access its contents.</p>

<a name="nick-complete"></a>
<h3>Automatic Username Completion or Drop-Down User Lists</h3>
<p>For small Bugzilla installations, Bugzilla supports showing all users
  in a drop-down list to select from, when reassigning bugs to another
  user, adding a user to the CC list, or many other areas.</p>

<p>Administrators can control who appears in these drop-down lists
  for each user with "user visibility" controls, to prevent certain
  users from knowing about the existence of other users.</p>

<p>For larger installations, Bugzilla supports "autocomplete" when
  typing a username for the assignee, CC list, or other field that takes
  a username. After you type at least three characters into one of these
  fields, Bugzilla will suggest a list of users who have those letters in
  their username or their real name.</p>

<a name="patchviewer"></a>
<h3>Patch Viewer</h3>
<p>Patch Viewer gives you a nice, colorful view of any patch
  attached to a bug. It also integrates with LXR, CVS, and Bonsai
  to provide you even more information about a patch.</p>

<p>In particular, it makes code review much easier.</p>

<a name="watching"></a>
<h3>"Watch" Other Users</h3>
<p>In Bugzilla, you can say that you want to "watch" another user.
  Then, you will get every email that users gets from Bugzilla,
  as though that user was you. This is particularly useful when
  one developer goes on vacation and another needs to handle that
  developer's bugs while the other developer is on vacation.</p>

<p>This doesn't allow you to bypass security--if you don't have access
  to a bug, you won't get notifications about it, no matter what.</p>

<a name="moving"></a>
<h3>Move Bugs Between Installations</h3>
<p>Bugzilla supports the ability to move a bug from one Bugzilla installation
  to another. This even works across versions--you can move a bug from
  a Bugzilla 2.16 installation to a Bugzilla 3.0 installation without
  having to do any manual work.</p>

<a name="saved-searches"></a>
<h3>Save and Share Searches</h3>
<p>Once you have performed a search, you can "save" it so that it appears
  in the footer of every page and all you have to do to run it again is
  click the link.</p>

<p>Once you have saved a search, if you have the right permissions you
  can also share that search with any group that you belong to in Bugzilla.
  Then they will have the option of displaying your search in their
  footer along with their searches!</p>

<h2>For Administrators</h2>

<a name="security"></a>
<h3>Excellent Security</h3>
<p>The Bugzilla Project takes security seriously. Bugzilla runs under Perl's
  "taint" mode to prevent SQL Injection, and has a very careful system in
  place to prevent Cross-Site Scripting. Bugzilla's history of patching 
  security vulnerabilities is excellent, and the system is designed at 
  every stage with security in mind.</p>

<p>Bugzilla is also very careful about information leaks--if you use Bugzilla's
  group system to hide something, it is <em>absolutely hidden</em>. Nobody
  will be able to get any information about it whatsoever.</p>

<p>Also, email addresses of users are not available to logged out users, to
  make life harder to spammers. And if someone tries to abuse your account
  by guessing your password, this account will be automatically locked after
  a few attempts to prevent brute force.</p>

<a name="extensions"></a>
<h3>Extension Mechanism for Highly Customizable Installations</h3>

<p>All of Bugzilla's User Interface and every email that Bugzilla sends
  are generated from "templates", files that contain mostly just HTML, CSS,
  and JavaScript. Depending on how far you want to customize your installation,
  you don't have to know Perl to customize Bugzilla, you just have to edit
  the templates!</p>

<p>For more complex tasks, Bugzilla has a very advanced Extensions system
  that allows you drop files into any Bugzilla installation and change its
  behavior in various ways. There is a
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Addons#Bugzilla_Extensions">list
  of available extensions</a> that you can install on your Bugzilla, and
  also very extensive 
  <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/tip/en/html/api/Bugzilla/Extension.html">documentation
  on how to write your own Extension</a>. Extensions are a great
  way to write customizations for Bugzilla that you can maintain with
  few changes even across major releases of Bugzilla!</p>

<a name="custom-fields"></a>
<h3>Custom Fields</h3>
<p>Bugzilla supports adding custom fields to your bug database, to
  capture and search data that is unique to your organization! Many different
  types of custom fields are supported, and you can even display them based
  on the value of another field, to only use them when they are relevant.</p>

<a name="custom-workflow"></a>
<h3>Custom Workflow</h3>
<p>Bugzilla comes with a default list of bug statuses and resolutions,
  as well as a default workflow. But they can all be edited to better
  match your needs. This means bug statuses and resolutions can be created
  or deleted very easily, and the workflow is fully customizable.</p>

<a name="unicode"></a>
<h3>Full Unicode Support</h3>
<p>All of Bugzilla fully supports Unicode, including multi-byte languages
  such as Japanese and Chinese. You can enter data into Bugzilla in
  Unicode, and you can search and sort all data correctly in Unicode.</p>

<a name="localization"></a>
<h3>Localization</h3>
<p>Bugzilla administrators can configure which languages are supported by
  their installations and automatically serve correct, localized content
  to users based on the HTTP 'Accept-Language' header sent from users'
  browsers.</p>

<p>There are currently localized templates available for:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Belarusian</li>
        <li>Bulgarian</li>
        <li>Chinese</li>
        <li>Czech</li>
        <li>French</li>
        <li>German</li> 
        <li>Japanese</li> 
        <li>Polish</li>
        <li>Portuguese (Brazil)</li>
        <li>Spanish (Spain or Mexico)</li>
        <li>Russian</li>
</ul>
<p>These localized template packs are third-party contributions, may only
  be available for specific versions, and may not be supported in the
  future. (See the <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/download/#localizations">Localizations
  Section</a> of the Download page.)</p>

<p>It is also possible to translate Bugzilla yourself, by just copying and
  translating the existing templates. See the
  <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/localizer.html">Localizer's Guide</a>
  for more information!</p>

<a name="mod_perl"></a>
<h3>mod_perl Support for Excellent Performance</h3>
<p>Bugzilla can be run under Apache's 
  <a href="http://perl.apache.org/">mod_perl</a>, which greatly speeds up
  individual page loads. Bugzilla pages often load in under a second when
  running under mod_perl.</p>

<p>Bugzilla also runs in a non-mod_perl environment, so you can run it
  under Apache's normal mod_cgi, IIS, or the web server of your choice!</p>

<a name="webservices"></a>
<h3>Webservices (XML-RPC and JSON-RPC) Interfaces</h3>
<p>Bugzilla can be accessed and modified by an XML-RPC or a JSON-RPC
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:WebService">Webservices
  interface</a>.
  This makes it possible to write external tools that interact with Bugzilla
  easily. The Bugzilla Project works to keep the Webservice interface of
  Bugzilla stable across releases, so an application written against one
  version of Bugzilla's XML-RPC or JSON-RPC interface should continue to work
  against future Bugzilla versions.</p>

<a name="groups"></a>
<h3>Control Bug Visibility/Editing with Groups</h3>
<p>Bugzilla allows you to define which groups of users can edit or see 
  which bugs. These controls are very advanced, and were designed to support
  small-group needs to full enterprise group systems.</p>

<a name="sudo"></a>
<h3>Impersonate Users</h3>
<p>Bugzilla administrators can impersonate any user in the system
  (except other administrators). This helps for troubleshooting, and
  also is useful at other times.</p>

<a name="auth"></a>
<h3>Multiple Authentication Methods</h3>
<p>Bugzilla supports authenticating against its built-in user database or
  against an LDAP server.</p>

<p>It also supports fall-through authentication, so that it can use
  any authentication method supported by Apache (or your web server).</p>

<p>You can also "stack" these authentication methods, so that, for example,
  it falls back to the Bugzilla database if the user isn't found in LDAP.</p>
    
<a name="dbs"></a>
<h3>Support for Multiple Database Engines</h3>
<p>Bugzilla can run on MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle. MS-SQL is on the road
  and should be supported in the near future. It's also possible to write
  a driver for the database of your choice.</p>

<a name="sanity"></a>
<h3>Sanity Check</h3>
<p>Bugzilla's Sanity Check scans your database for inconsistencies. It
  reports errors and either offers to fix them automatically or gives
  you links to help you fix the problem.</p>
